Second, because development is capital intensive. Pratt & Whitney develops new turbine blade designs, and patents them because developing them is tremendously expensive. In software, there is a huge field of things that are patentable that don't fulfill the economic rationale of patent (protecting expensive capital investment from free riding).

There is no faster way to do this task. Therefore one can assume A and B's execution time are equal.Yet B operates in a secure sand-boxed environment with a time sharing OS.

Until you absolutely need sub-millisecond precision I/O, then you kinda start to cry when you realize how hard precise timing in computers is.If you use lab equipment in say Linux, BSD, OSX, Windows. Your using a time shared, not Read-Time OS. So your I/O events aren't when the event happens, but when the scheduler is damn well ready to let you know the event happened.The easiest example is a timing equipment I was using to count digital pulses form a quartz crystal. In a 'modern' secure OS I couldn't really get below 0.1% margin of error. Which wasn't acceptable for the equipment which wasn't low enough for our uses. I fall back to an older insecure real-time platform and bumped up to 0.005%.Security is great. I attend security conferences in my spare time and try to stay up to date on the topic.

It's an emergent property of the way node loads modules, which is also pretty darn simple.When you give Node a package to require, if it doesn't refer to a relative or absolute path, it walks up the directory structure looking for `node_modules`. When it finds one, it looks inside for the module you asked for. If it doesn't find it, it keeps walking up the directory tree.So you can have multiple module repositories in a directory tree. A given file will always find the one that's ""closest.""Npm takes advantage of this by installing every module's dependencies in a `node_modules` directory in the root directory of that module. Subdependencies' dependencies go in their node_modules directory. Voila! Isolated dependencies, braindead simple, albeit with a crazy deep directory structure.

Some idiot flying along an established route without his transponder is a problem for ATC, not air defense, and that seems to be the best explanation for #1 and #3, probably even #2. Sure, Vietnam noticed and tried to inform Malaysia, but countries upstream from the route might not have cared (they probably wouldn't have seen it turn, either).But you're right, Malaysia hasn't done a stellar job organizing the search and recovery (understatement of the year aware goes to...). The real problem, though, is that no one has any idea what's going on.I admit. There's something fantastical to consider about a plane, under control of a rogue pilot (or pilots), clandestinely flying to a location for possible future use in an elaborate terror plot. The only caveat is that the logistics of such a thing would require so much preliminary planning in terms of fueling, storing/hiding the plane somewhere, or outright repainting it, that it very nearly requires the resources of a state actor or another determined (and secretive) foe. And who would be the target? The simplest solution, then, is to speculate that there was some sort of emergency on board, the pilots became confused (or incapacitated and the plane was operating on autopilot), and the aircraft is now at the bottom of the sea.Returning to the article: It's easy to blame countries near the Indian Ocean of being highly secretive about their capabilities. I'm sure they are, of course, (and certainly need to be) but there's something about the elaborate hijacking plot that seems amazingly complicated and difficult to pull off. Moreover, as time wears on, the probability of being discovered increases, and I'm sure other states (Israel) might be keeping an eye on potential suspects (Iran) for such activity anyway, simply out of paranoia. Further, how easy is it to disappear a plane and keep it hidden for weeks, months, or indefinitely? One instance [1] comes to mind, but with 239 people on board...? That's to say nothing about finding a runway large enough to land such a beast that is also not well monitored.I'll say this: It'd make great fiction, certainly, but I think the crux of the matter is something we don't do well as humans. We don't like to admit that we don't know the answer. And this could become the mystery of the century if it's never found. However, I'm inclined to believe it was an emergency of some sort (at least I hope).

When I left IBM to start my own company I invented more than I did at IBM, but I chose to license our technology to the Open Software Foundation instead of patenting it.Part of my thinking in not filing for patents was that the big companies that were our biggest competitors (IBM, HP, Sun, DEC) wouldn't be slowed down by patents.  They had armies of lawyers and big portfolios of patents and inventions that would be used against us if we tried to enforce any of our patents against them.  Whether or not any of their claims were valid, we would not have been able to afford the legal battle and would have been forced to cross-license with them anyway.Patent protection for software has always bothered me. Patents that made sense in the days of steam engines just don't work well for software.  Patents give too much protection (preventing independent discovery of some idea from being used) and last too long, way too long for the software industry (I think 4 years is plenty of time to get exclusive use for an idea in software).Ideally, I would like to see patent protection to software eliminated and replaced with a much easier to obtain protection for a couple of years.

But to wait so long and ignore so much is well beyond what ought to have happened.Edit: especially in the 9/11-paranoid US and other similarly fearful countries, the plane would have been noticed on military radar in real time and would have been intercepted right away, and this whole question of who knew what when and how long it's reasonable to search in the wrong place would have been avoided because the fighter pilots would have watched the thing sail off with their own eyes."

Yet it didn't actually come to light until days later, and then when it did their immediate reaction was to deny that it was true! It took another couple of days before they finally settled down and admitted, yes, we tracked this plane flying completely out of the search area and far away from where we've been telling everyone it is.

I'm in a newly built neighborhood, and the mailboxes are all in groups. There's a  bunch of big boxes each containing 12-15 small mailboxes, one per house. Each big box also contains one or two larger mailboxes for packages. When I get a package that doesn't fit in the small letter box, the mailman puts it in one of the package boxes, then puts the key in my mailbox. Some clever mechanical design makes it so that the key can't be removed from the package lock once inserted, and so it stays there to be recovered and reused by the mailman.There are two problems with this approach:1. The package box is still fairly small, so bigger items have to go the more traditional route.2. Much more importantly, since it's with the mailboxes, only the USPS can use them. UPS, FedEx, and others are stuck with the more traditional approach.Still, it's a start. With the massive increase in packages being delivered perhaps it will become more common."

Sure, it can track your heart rate at rest, but during intensive exercise there is no comparison with something like a Polar chest strap. At the same time the claim that the B1 can monitor your sleep phase based on your heart rate is a bit far fetched as well. From what I've read the heart rate does not change by more than 1-2 bpm between REM and deep sleep, which is within the margin of error of the measurements, so the data out will be all wrong.

Such children can't focus for 5 minutes on a single thing. Like, if you ask them to draw something, or to play a game, or if you read them a story or whatever, there are children that once past the 5 or 10 minutes mark lose their focus completely and shift their attention to something else, being a constant struggle to win back their attention.Or maybe these are in fact 2 different disorders? It does take motivation on my part to focus on things that I don't like. Plus I think doctors are too quick to prescribe medication to children, which is my only problem with an ADHD diagnostic - as focus is also a matter of training (i.e. the interest for hearing stories or drawing stuff doesn't develop overnight) and parents, from lack of time, prefer to succumb to giving their children drugs instead of reflecting on their interactions at home.So you know, I've got a mixed feeling about this - on one hand I've seen children and even grown men that can't focus on anything at all, so I'm sure ADHD is real, on the other hand it's often misdiagnosed and those drugs may in fact do more harm than good in many cases."

The conclusion is that those systems and the prevailing distrust they represent is useless and counterproductive.Knowing that they don't belong in the harnesses designed for ""the slow kids"", highly intelligent people tend to assume that everyone deserves more trust than they are given by society. It isn't just a personal problem (""I'm too smart to be treated like a child"") but a general one (""Who needs rules? Who needs management at all?"") This biases them toward premature trust of others."

It wouldn't be so bad if there were a sizable pool (say, 30 days) but usually, it's an excuse to present the company as having ample vacation (15-20 days) while actually deducting sick days from it. It means that a week-long illness will cut into your vacation.Then you have this arrangement where people ""work from home"" (WFH) while actually ill, just to avoid losing a PTO day. Then you need a manager who understands the difference between sick WFH (don't hit him up, he might read emails and type out a few replies and that's it) and real WFH (you can actually expect that person to be working)-- and who, in addition, cares about that distinction."
634,7526,2.19722457733622,9.0,"The problem with software engineers is that they embrace Cluelessness. Read up on the MacLeod hierarchy. Venkatesh Rao's series is a great place to start: http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-o... . You can also read the series I began last February: http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/gervais-princ... . Those'll take a few hours.The MacLeod pyramid has bare-minimum players (Losers) at the bottom. They aren't really losers in the sense of being undesirable or weak; they know employment is a losing proposition and commit minimally (rational disengagement). In the middle are the overeager Clueless, destined for middle management but rarely able to cross the barrier (effort thermocline, which is where jobs transition from getting harder as one moves up to getting easier) between them and the cynical, politically savvy but rarely eager executives. At the top are the Sociopaths who are openly out for personal gain. Again, Sociopaths aren't all bad (the label is more negative than what it describes) but what they are is self-interested and insubordinate. They won't put the organization's interests above theirs, and why should they?The Clueless tier is the worst place to be, because you become the company's true janitors. You're always cleaning up the messes made by the bare-minimum players below you and the self-interested, capricious gods of industry above you. It leads to overwork and burnout (which can be the first step toward cluefulness and cynicism). You eat buttloads of a pie you don't especially like (even if you once did, in moderation) and the prize for winning the pie-eating contest is... more of that same pie.Software culture embraces the culture of the middle tier (the Clueless). Startup cults are even worse. They hire specifically to maintain certain illusions, and exclude people who might contradict those (i.e. over-40 engineers who might say, ""I've been here before"" when a death march begins or a ridiculous executive promise, never to be delivered, is made to motivate people to sacrifice their health.) The real reason these cultish startups discriminate on age and gender is that they don't want to let in people who have the perspective to call the execs out on their bullshit.Some people, steeped in middle-class eagerness and Cluelessness, struggle with the cognitive dissonance that hits when they realize that (a) there are no adults over adults-- something people've desired for thousands of years, so much as to make them up out of vapor and call them ""gods""-- and (b) no organization is a meritocracy and advancement is always political. It's not ""who you know"" over ""what you know"". It's what you have over those other two things. Knowing people isn't enough. What can you do for (or to) people? Rather than acknowledge the ugly truth, they plow into their work (heads in sand) hoping the ugliness will go away. It never does. It starts to look like a context-driven case of OCD (""I have to get this done and it has to be perfect""). For some, it leads to exactly this."

The same was true of the support team too. I then left and the company survived the shock just fine, so clearly I was replaceable too. So yes developers are vital, there would be no product without a development team to develop it, but then without a sales team it would never get sold. Without a support team it would be unsupported, etc. Removing any one team would be like cutting one of the organs out of someone's body. Sure you can outsource stuff, but the function being outsourced still needs to get done.The problem comes when people from one world start making the decisions about how to run one of the other worlds. In my experience it's pretty rare for a technologist to try and tell the sales and marketing team how to do their job and expend their resources. Unfortunately I've seen several companies essentially collapse because really good sales and marketing people tried to run the engineering groups and make what are fundamentally technical decisions. I've never yet seen that end well.I think it's partly because if you run a duff sales campaign, you can regroup and try an alternate strategy relatively quickly. The problem with development projects is they can take several years to come to fruition and if you're on the wrong path it can take several more years to fix the problems.

Unfortunately those waves could not be detected directly.In principle, a gravity wave could have nearly any frequency/wavelength consistent with its source. The pulsars discussed above were thought to produce gravitational waves of relatively high frequency / short wavelength, proportional to their pulse repetition rates. A so-called ""millisecond pulsar"" would have a possible gravitational wave frequency of one kilohertz and a wavelength of 3 x 10^8 / f meters or 3,000,000 meters (3,000 kilometers).

But as I said I do not see how running ports of Linux tools on that layer qualifies as real Mac support.>What feedback is that?Different types of software get developed for Windows, trying to use Rust in these different scenarios might have exposed issues specific to said use cases. Demanding PC games are overwhelmingly developed on and for Windows for starters. And there is also the issue of ""cultural incest"". There are certain hegemonic attitudes among UNIX developers about how thinks should work, how they should be organized, named etc. Attitudes which are often not shared by other developer communities. However, the early development of C++ happened in a UNIX dominated environment too so maybe this will not be that problematic.>you talk about a binary installer. That's not something we have on any platform yet.The thing is, just dropping source tarballs on people is considered acceptable among UNIX developers, that is the way you do things there. But it is not the way you do things on Windows.>Of course I would, if they were competent developers.The issue is not technical competence, but ""cultural competence"" if you will. Building software people on platform X actually want to use, which requires respecting the cultural norms. You just gave a nice example of lacking cultural competence by assuming that not providing a binary installer which does not require manual twiddling is just as acceptable on Windows as on Linux, while it really sends a bad message on Windows and leads to Windows developers never bothering with Rust at all. It is like, nobody on Windows has a problem with closed source drivers .. but the Linux devs hate those.. bad culture fit. It matters, a lot.>There are tons of popular C++ package managers: Homebrew and apt-get, to name a couple.apt-get is the Debian package manager, Homebrew is for UNIX devs using the POSIX layer of OS X, neither is a ""C++ package manager"". These pieces of software are OS specific tools and have no direct relation to the C++ programming language at all.>That is also precisely what Rust does.Well, that is great. However, I remain highly skeptical. I can already see the install instruction for Rust libraries on Github etc. ""Cargo install foobar"", no word about how to build the library without Cargo, the dependencies are only specified in Cargo metadata files etc. Plus as I said package managers encourage developers to write software with lots of dependencies .. which becomes a pain to build without said package manager. While in theory Cargo may be optional, I doubt it will be in practice. The whole Rust ecosystem will grow based on the assumption that everyone uses Cargo, and everyone who does not will be in for a world of pain. Other languages who have official package managers show this.>Mozilla is not going to invest in a language that won't work on Windows, for obvious reasons.There is a big difference between being able to turn your particular code base into Windows binaries and actually providing a good development experience on Windows. The first does not necessarily require the second. I think most (all?) Mozilla devs use a UNIX-style development environment, even if Windows is the dominant target platform.>First-class support for Windows is evident everywhere in the design, from the use of libuv instead of libevent for the green threading to the lack of exposure of `select` or `fork` due to that not performing well on Windows.Again, I was mostly talking about the developer experience, not about the ability to somehow build fast binaries. That is expected too of course, but not enough for the ""first class"" label in my book.>To what? Abandoning the package manager?Yes. See above for the reasons why. When I build my C++ software on Linux I do not need a special ""C++ package manager"". I just apt-get the dependencies (e.g. SDL). Does Rust really need something more? As I said, I think a language specific package manager will undermine Rust's ability to be a general C++ replacement.>and somewhat insultingI did not mean to insult anyone.

One of the many things wrong with the ""package manager"" paradigm is that it encourages people to write software which is a tangled web of dependencies. Software should have few third-party dependencies, that makes maintenance and porting a lot easier. Witness the recent Python 2 -> 3 drama. The primary reason why people did not, could not upgrade to Python 3 was because they had to wait for all the dependencies of their apps to be ported. Many are still waiting."

Every language which needs a ""package manager"" tends to make building standalone applications painful.I do think C++ is in dire need of being replaced, it is unsafe at any speed and full of legacy cruft. Unfortunately D jumped on the GC train and had other serious issues as well, allowing C++ to survive that attempt without a scratch.Rust finally did the right thing, aiming for the same zero overhead/you only pay for what you use design which made C++ such a success.However, C++ is a platform agnostic language, while Rust thus far has only supported Linux as a first class  platform. I find the attitude of the Rust devs (""we will improve Windows support once the language is stable"") deeply misguided. It meant that they largely missed out on feedback from Windows developers during the development of the language. ""Windows developers"" also means all the AAA PC(+console) game developers (the most diehard C++ users). Linux still is not a relevant platform there.And the Rust developers seem to continue to go down that rabbit hole by enlisting Ruby developers to develop a ""package manager"".

How is that thing going to integrate with Visual Studio and other Windows specific concerns?\nRuby only really works on Linux, first advice you get as a Windows guy wanting to learn Ruby is ""Install Linux, if you try to do Ruby development on Windows you are in for a world of pain"". I do not trust any Ruby developer to write portable software, they are married to the GNU/Linux  ecosystem. Would you expect Microsoft guys to develop something which actually works well on Linux?Also remember that C++ does not have a ""package manager"". Some of the most complex and massive applications in the world are written in C++, yet you do not hear many C++ developers crying ""When will we finally get a package manager?"". It is not even on the agenda. C does not have one either.""Package managers"" are a Linux-ism, they deliver a certain UX you may or may not like (personally I hate it with passion), but they should not be part of a platform agnostic programming language. A package manager may belong to a Linux development environment for Rust, but the language itself and its library handling should be completely independent of it. Rust libraries should work just like C++ libraries so that they do integrate well with other development environments.I see Rust becoming a new OCaml, utterly Linux-centric and thus leaving C++ as the sole competitor in the maximal performance + high-level abstractions + platform agnostic  category.For the sake of games no longer crashing randomly because of memory corruption bugs: change course now."

In fact, I would expect the package management on an embedded system to be driven by another system, which may be POSIX compliant. That software that puts code on that embedded system or console could be an extension to an existing package manager.The biggest issue with most package managers AFAICT is that most aren't designed first as a platform with a programmatic interface.

When someone tells me they go to the gym regularly I ask how far they live from the gym and it is typical that the gym is extremely convenient for them (usually within a few blocks in a city or a few minutes drive in the suburbs).I started asking this when I noticed the impact of convencient on my exercise habits. I myself was in the best shape of my life when I lived two blocks from a gym. It made going to the gym an ""impulse"" option for which I didn't have to set aside time in my schedule. I went practically everyday, but not at a set time in the day. It's easy to maintain a daily habit that you can do at any time during the day. It's much harder to maintain a habit that you only have one or two slots of time available in the day to do, since every other concern that can't wait and need to be done during your exercise slots threatens making exercise a habit.For example, I think both Asana and Heroku have it right by making wellness accessible.

I'd google the problem, and I'd see what solutions are out there.

I solve novel problems every day -- just not on a whiteboard and not in 15 minutes.I would much much much rather see a real-world problem. Something you've actually run into.

The guy basically ended the interview right there, but I asked for the solution.

On top of that, they usually command lower pay than the domestic laborers in the same market, so this leaves them with very little in the way of spending money. They also work relentless hours, 7 days a week. So their life is basically wake, work, sleep with stops for meals 3 times a day.There are more than just workers though, the women who come tend to end up in lower-end service jobs, house cleaners, cheap day care etc. And some of them have kids who are right now, very young and not in the job market (meaning no disposable income).Both groups are well serviced by their local Mercado Latino and Walmart in terms of most needs and their children, if they've brought them here, are usually too young to want to shop at stylish mall shops.If you look at the kinds of places that service the community, they aren't high-end restaurants and retail shops offering comforts from home. It's cheap fast food, pupusa shops, check cashing, cheap phone calls home etc. A visit to local pawn shops in and around Manassas will reveal shelf after shelf full of tools laborers have sold as they head back home after the housing bust, and are usually in shopping centers full of Spanish language shops.

I think probably the only groups with any say-so in the direction it grew were the Battlefield protectionist groups.But all that was very much a product of the Western expansion of 66. Most of the older folks in the area remember when 66 didn't come out that far and Manassas was just the 234/28 intersection and 28 East to Manassas Park.When something was done, we end up with bizarreness like two entirely different roads called ""234"", one that goes through the main strip of town, and the other that goes through countryside and bypasses the commercial center entirely...which no doubt hasn't helped the commercial interests of that area at all.I know from growing up out there that the anti-battlefield people put a really bad taste in lots of big commercial company's mouths.

So you can put it behind a raw tcp api, or a 0mq bus, or a command line front-end, etc., without needing to change anything but the adapters.It is very reasonable to question whether this is really all that useful or whether doing it from the start is a premature optimization, but it isn't pointless."

Both dynamic and static power are not decreasing proportionally with node size, and therefore we have gotten to the point of asking ""why add them if we can't use them?"". This is the problems of the power wall and the observation that we must continue to turn off more and more of our silicon if we can't scale dynamic and static power characteristics of transistors with their size. This problem threatens the well being of all semi conductor companies.Do you think that Intel will just surrender and go bankrupt? If they don't defeat this problem, soon companies will have no reason to buy chips from Intel. So what if they have 2x the cores on the chip if you can only keep half of them active? Without breakthroughs in energy storage and heat dissipation, how can google/apple/... create exciting new compute devices if the processors continue to sip as much power as they did two years ago?

Finding out my commute needs to go a different way, or I should plan for it to be a bit longer (or shorter, sometimes!) doesn't seem depressing to me.I keep a pretty close eye on how Google is using my information, and if I begin to feel like it has crossed a line from mutual benefit (helping me, and deriving value as well) to something more one-sided (exploiting me for value), I hope I won't prove to have been naive, but in the meantime, this is something that really seems to make my life better.

1328,1952,1.3862943611198906,4.0,"Well Rails is a solid full-stack framework that is fairly modular, and of course ruby is extremely flexible in the architectural choices it allows, so it's very easy to take Rails in different directions by instituting your own conventions.  It's probably easier to do this then to either pick a minimalist framework like Sinatra and build everything up from scratch, or find another language with a framework that suits your exact preferences.I totally agree that Rails defaults hit a certain sweet spot.  Putting a bit of logic in the controllers is fine in most apps, ActiveRecord is intended to mix persistence and business logic because many models aren't complex enough to merit separating them.  Starting with a Hexagonal approach may well be premature optimization.  I get it.But lets be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water.  Rails intelligent defaults do have a tendency to leave a vacuum for apps reaching a certain level of complexity.  That doesn't mean Rails isn't still useful, but just that it becomes inelegant when you don't have any conventions to deal with this and start hacking ad-hoc solutions into your codebase.  I have a sneaking suspicion that partially this is inevitable in any living codebase, and that a complex system almost by definition can not be consistent and elegant since it is inevitably built over time under changing conditions.  But in any case, I think Rails is a perfectly good place to experiment with ideas for managing complexity in a sizable app."

1405,4557,2.8903717578961645,18.0,"There's a good philosophy of science argument to be made that there's no precise and discrete distinction between direct and indirect measurement.  In our model of the universe, there are always multiple physical steps that link the phenomena under investigation to our conscious perception.  Therefore, any conclusions we draw from a perception are conditional on our confidence in the entire causal chain performing reliably (e.g. a gravitational wave induces a B-mode in the CMB, which propagates as a photon to our detectors, which heats up a transition-edge sensor, which increases the resistivity of the circuit, which flips a bit in the flash memory, which is read out to a monitor, which emits photons to our eye, which change the nerves firing in our brain).  ""Direct"" measurements, then, are just ones that rely on a small number of reliable inferences, while ""indirect"" measurements rely on a large number of less reliable inferences.Nonetheless, in practice there is a rather clear distinction which declares ""direct"" measurements to be those that take place locally (in space) using well-characterized equipment that we can (importantly) manipulate, and which is conditional only on physical laws which are very strongly established.  All other measurements are called ""indirect"", generally because they are observational (i.e. no manipulation of the experimental parameters), are conditional on tenuous ideas (i.e. naturalness arguments as indirect evidence for supersymmetry), and/or involve intermediary systems that are not well understood (e.g. galactic dynamics).The classic example is dark matter detection.  A detector built in your laboratory that produces clear evidence of a local interaction between the dark matter partice and the atoms composing the detector would be ""direct detection"".  Seeing an anomalous excess of gamma rays from the center of the galaxy whose energy and distribution is consistent with some theories which predict dark matter annihilation would be ""indirect detection"".Naturally, direct measurements have a much larger impact on your Bayesian credences than indirect ones.  If someone says ""I don't trust that indirect measurement"" they mean ""one or more steps in the inference chain which connects the phenomena to our perceptions is unreliable"".EDIT: Oh, it's worth replying more directly (ha!) to your comment by noting that both pulsar slow downshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Using_pulsa...and the CMB measurements by BICEPS are indisputably indirect.

Catherine Bracy, the author of this post, is an expert on issues of sexism in Silicon Valley, and what she says should carry weight here. The article I posted yesterday was written in the early 70s, and discussed problems in different (though perhaps strangely similar) settings. The words of a modern day expert well versed in Silicon Valley culture should certainly find their place here. I think it reflects badly on this community that HN was allowed to be indignant in the Aaron Swartz and Ed Snowden cases but not in this. This high standard of not adding new information to the discussion was not applied in those cases, as I distinctly remember the front page flooded with at least 5 similar stories on Snowden/Swartz (articles were flagged back then only after a dozen or so stories, and we're not there yet). In fact, HN should be reeling with indignation against all those who suddenly become cool observers and expert rhetoricians calling to suspend judgment.Whatever the particulars of the GitHub scandal turn out to be don't matter (for the purpose of this discussion). What better opportunity is there to discuss the very real problem of underrepresentation of women in SV than this? And what you call ""bait"" others might call raising awareness. This isn't the NRA talking after a school shootout, but someone discussing what is possibly the biggest problem in SV culture today as a response to a painful, though far from tragic event.I also find it problematic that a post by a prominent woman is found to be ""indignant and lacking in information"", while far worse stupidities by race-car driving programmers are featured prominently. At the very least, I think some affirmative action wouldn't hurt us. In fact, this could be our finest moment, and we're squandering it.ADD: it is perhaps ironic that Bracy implies that this revulsion from politics in SV is simply a form of a very destructive kind of politics, and flagging this story is precisely a case in point. It is a strong political statement that only nurtures what I think is very bad politics.I urge you to unflag the story unless you strongly believe that its appearance on the front page is somehow bad for HN."

This is a company that for years had a blog with little else than their drinking escapades. Perhaps that's changed, but the burden of proof is on them.The only thing that is up for dispute is whether this particular case is an example of sexism in tech or not.

Did HN mark me as a spammer or something, WTF?Anyway, here goes my original answer:- Code and results side by side.The screen is split in two, both have independent scrollbars.\n1) Left column, a roomy text editor (the minor annoyances like tabbing, or CTRL+S bringing the save page dialog are easily fixed in JS, heck there are full blown editors I could use if I care, with syntax highlighting etc.).\n2) Right column - results.\nOften when the result of your code is a large data structure in a CLI, you lose sight of your code - not here.- Entering larger structures (functions, classes)Often you need to copy a block of code and tinker with it and see what it produces. In CLI this can be either impossible, or awkward - you can't normally enter a class line by line, it should be entered at once. But in a roomy textarea, you can just paste it, and it just works.- Entering (and not losing) initialization codeLikewise for any initialization code. On the command line it's very easy to test one-liners, but code that requires setup, loading your current project environment, and instancing a few objects and configuring them, the CLI comes short.\nIf I do something wrong the CLI process might also die (fatal errors, exceptions, endless loops etc.), and lose my carefully set up test.\nWith an eval page, every time I type something, the entire block of code gets re-evaluated from scratch, including the state set-up, nothing is lost.- Copying code blocks back into my projectJust like it's easy to copy code form my project into the eval box, sometimes I produce a useful bit of code I want to paste back into my project. When you have code and results mixed in CLI that process becomes quite tedious. With the eval page textarea it's quick and natural.- I don't have to finish a line to see my results (or mistakes): real time evaluationIn a CLI you need to finish typing the line and hit Return to see what happens. Then to correct it, you hit up, the line is copied and you get the chance to correct it, but in the process littering your CLI history with useless entries that are confusingly similar (but most of them are wrong).\nIn an eval box, you can get live feedback as you type (I've made it so if you pause for 200ms, it re-executes the code and shows results), and you don't have to ""copy"" a line to fix it - the line is there, editable, so you just edit it.\nLet's say you're not quite sure about an argument format in some API call - tweak it, pause for a split moment, you see the result. Very easy to find the right code intuitively, by experimentation. Heck, sometimes it's faster than reading the documentation! Hehe.- The power of HTML, JS widgets and the browser's developer console all come out of the boxLast, but not least: if it's in the browser, it means you have access to HTML and JS widgets. If your result is HTML, you can see the HTML DOM rendered, not just the code.\nAnd you have access to the browser's own debugging console. I can dump an object tree to the console as a dynamic expandable tree with a set of little [+] and [-] buttons.\nIt's a different world entirely. A better world."

It goes beyond just knowing the registers and the mnemonics and explains in a fantastically clear way all the implicit work that's going on behind the scenes, even in assembly code. From the stack to data segments and direct video control, I learned more about how computers work from this book than from my entire college Computer Science program. And I didn't even have an assembler to actually try any of the code at the time I read it.I'm not sure if the book would still hold up from a practical perspective, as it does focus very much on MS-DOS-specific interrupts. So what I wonder is... is there a similar resource available today for learning what's going on behind the scenes in the modern 64-bit CPU on modern OSes?"

But he leaves out a lot that folks without much familiarity with ADHD won't already know, such as that many people with ADHD take medicines other than stimulants: anti-depressants, blood pressure medicines. A lot of drugs have been found to address the underlying problems, and each class works differently in different people.The fact is that, like every other aspect of brain chemistry and function, we understand very very little about ADHD. That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that people with the disorder should stop taking medicine that works for them. It means we need to study it more to find out how to better describe and explain all the intricate connections between behavior, diet, genetics, environment, sleep, screens, family, school, work, weather, vitamins, and drugs interplay to create what we now call ADHD."

If the package-manager-free workflow with manual installation (or through an IDE, etc.) is to your liking, use it!> However, C++ is a platform agnostic language, while Rust thus far has only supported Linux as a first class platform.Totally false. I'm the earliest developer still full-time on the Rust language (4+ years) and I was exclusively using Mac OS X from the beginning. If you look at Servo, Mac is actually better supported than Linux at the moment.Graydon was adamant that Windows must be supported from the start, and we have not changed that.> I find the attitude of the Rust devs (""we will improve Windows support once the language is stable"") deeply misguided. It meant that they largely missed out on feedback from Windows developers during the development of the language.What feedback is that? Most of the language-level concerns are platform-independent, except for COM, etc (which we are familiar with).Furthermore, we have Windows support, and it's not that far behind the other platforms. Later on in your comments, you talk about a binary installer. That's not something we have on any platform yet.> And the Rust developers seem to continue to go down that rabbit hole by enlisting Ruby developers to develop a ""package manager"". As a Windows guy the very word makes me cringe. How is that thing going to integrate with Visual Studio and other Windows specific concerns?You don't need to use it if you're using Visual Studio. If you like your tools, keep them! That's Rust's attitude.> I do not trust any Ruby developer to write portable software, they are married to the GNU/Linux ecosystem.

Some of the most complex and massive applications in the world are written in C++, yet you do not hear many C++ developers crying ""When will we finally get a package manager?"". It is not even on the agenda. C does not have one either.There are tons of popular C++ package managers: Homebrew and apt-get, to name a couple.> A package manager may belong to a Linux development environment for Rust, but the language itself and its library handling should be completely independent of it.That is precisely what Rust does.> Rust libraries should work just like C++ libraries so that they do integrate well with other development environments.That is also precisely what Rust does.> I see Rust becoming a new OCaml, utterly Linux-centric and thus leaving C++ as the sole competitor in the maximal performance + high-level abstractions + platform agnostic category.This is really silly and hyperbolic, and somewhat insulting to those of us who have spent a lot of time making sure the design works well on Windows. Like I said, I've been working full-time on this project longer than anyone else and I exclusively use a Mac.Mozilla is not going to invest in a language that won't work on Windows, for obvious reasons. We have a lot of Windows developers here too, you know.First-class support for Windows is evident everywhere in the design, from the use of libuv instead of libevent for the green threading to the lack of exposure of `select` or `fork` due to that not performing well on Windows.> For the sake of games no longer crashing randomly because of memory corruption bugs: change course now.To what?

That'd be alienating a large segment of users who want a tool to create and share libraries, and deploy binaries onto servers for the sake of unhappy Windows developers who dislike that workflow.

Of course Rust is not stable now; as I said, we're making the biggest breaking changes now so that we don't have to make them later.> I think it'll be safe to say that Rust is headed toward stability once you've committed to not making any more breaking language or library changes, you have a separate code branch receiving only fixes, there are releases available, and at least some assurance is given that any issues that do arise will at least be investigated for a reasonably long period of time.That's called ""1.0"".

It's not enough to be a ""founder of X company"", there's a minimum about of press, articles published, conferences attended and awards/prizes INCLUDING awards from the applicant's home country (so they must have international level achievement)What class of visas would investors be allowed to have sway over? The govt. could make a case that a startup visa is a loophole around HI-B1 because it doesn't nessescarily demonstrate a skillset not already owned by an American.

Hmm.  I may as well guess your technique openly:Your technique must be something unexpected, and seemingly unrelated to ""actions that fraudsters would normally be careful not to give themselves away with.""  So I'm going to guess that the technique is to analyze the linguistic traits of each user's password.  Most people reuse passwords, and if the fraudsters share a similar cultural background then the password has a decent chance of giving away the fact that a particular user is from that same cultural background, e.g. if the password contains a foreign dictionary word in their native tongue yet their their purported home address is in a completely different country.  That sort of thing.Or if the same group of fraudsters keep reusing the same passwords, or even parts of their previous passwords, then that would probably be enough to accurately detect them.  Most people who don't use a password manager tend to reuse substrings of their prior passwords, so they end up leaving a pretty distinctive identity ""footprint"" by the type of passwords they choose.  Their passwords are likely to share a similar structure, such as always consisting of two words followed by two numbers, for example, or always starting their passwords with two symbols like %#.And of course, if the fraudsters became aware that their password was giving themselves away, they'd trivially dodge the detector in the future.Hmm.

My experience with Ada was on decidedly not open source projects, and Ada suffered in this respect in that there wasn't a good open source Ada compiler until long after interest in Ada outside of the defense industry faded. Googling for ""ada open source"" shows a good number of interesting (if dated) possibilities (these might be a good place to start: http://www.pegasoft.ca/resources/boblap/book.html and http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~mfeldman/ada-project-summary.html), but not to put to fine a point on it, the cool kids pretty much decided Ada was the US DoD equivalent of COBOL 20 years ago and ignored it.As an aside, Ada was intended for large numbers of programmers of varying, often mediocre skill to cooperate on large programs while minimizing errors and preventing localized programming errors from propagating too far.  That's something a lot of OSS projects could use.I also think it's important to understand that Ada was one branch of a family of languages descended from ALGOL that looked at the problem through a similar lens (a very not-C/C++ lens).  Pascal is the direct ancestor, of course, but in a addition to Ada, Pascal evolved into a number of other systems programming languages like Modula-2 & -3 and the various Oberons.  Close cousins Mesa & Cedar were Xerox PARC systems programming languages.  There's not a lot left of the Modula's or Mesa/Cedar (regrettably...Modula-2 was much better than Pascal for non-academic programming and Modula-3 was a really comfortable all-around language), but there's a reasonable amount of OSS Oberon laying about.EDIT: How could I forget...if systems programming is your kink, be sure to check out UCSD p-code and ETH m-code.

2120,1976,1.0986122886681098,3.0,"Here's a non-comprehensive list of issues I have with bundler.  Don't get me wrong, I think in many ways it's a lot better than what we had before.  But I also don't believe it's advanced much since its initial debut and think we can do better (and yes, I've tried on that front):* You can't override a dependency:This may very well be an issue with rubygems, but I'd have hoped bundler adoption would have fixed it if that's the case.  Since dependencies and their versions cannot be overridden, transitive dependency conflicts are a constant minefield.  The naive solution is to modify your gemspec to be overly permissive and I get pressure to do this frequently with gems I work on.  But, now I'm asserting that my gem works with some hypothetical dependency that hasn't been release yet.  And I've watched that blow up many times.  Semantic versioning does not fix this.* Dependencies can disappear on you:Yanked gems irk me, but I appreciate their value in preventing the installation of an unwanted version when one isn't specified.  However, it also explicitly blocks installation of a particular version, effectively ignoring the version specification in Gemfile.  I may be romanticizing things here, but I don't recall ever seeing a non-SNAPSHOT published artifact being removed when I was working with maven or ivy.What's frustrating is the gem still exists, but not in the index.  I guess I would expect Bundler to realize I do want to install the version I've specified and fetch the file and do the installation.  Ultimate control in my dependency graph should rest with me, not the whim of an upstream developer.  I realize this is a rubygems.org thing, but it also strikes me as a solvable problem that many don't see as a problem.  And it means that checking out historical copies of my app almost certainly will not run without changing the Gemfile(.lock), which seems like a core value in a dependency management tool.In any event, you will only discover this when deploying to a machine that has come up since the gem was yanked.  Common staging server and CI strategies don't catch this since it's essentially a race condition in the gem ecosystem.  You simply won't find out until your deploy fails.  It undermines any trust in the ecosystem and the only viable solutions are: 1) run your own gem server; 2) modify gemcutter to dismiss all yanks, or 3) vendor every gem your app uses.* It has weird rules:  gem 'x', platform: :mri\n  gem 'y', platform: :jruby\n\nworks the way you'd expect, but  gem 'z', git: 'whatever', branch: 'mri_compat'\n  gem 'z', git: 'whatever', branch: 'jruby_compat'\n\nwill not.  Apparently the dependency graph can't be resolved if the gem names aren't unique.  The platform part isn't taken into consideration from what I gather.  This made it really hard when I was trying to port some C ext. gems to a JRuby equivalent.* It promotes bad practices:This one is admittedly contentious, but given bundler was created basically for Rails 3 and Rails is the worst abuser, it's also hard to divorce the two.  But requiring your entire dependency graph up front is just not a good idea.  It's bad for performance and it's bad for memory.  It's why apps take 30s to boot.  Most non-trivial Rails apps I've come across are basically multi-tiered applications in a monolithic codebase.  That means fog is getting loaded in controllers and haml is getting loaded in Sidekiq jobs.  It's just a very odd situation.  I've tried to defer loading, but this is a battle that's hardly worth fighting because of railties.  Auditing every gem to see if it has a railtie is tiresome and invalidated as soon as a new version comes out.  If a gem has a railtie, it needs to be required at a very specific point in the Rails boot cycle, otherwise your app just won't work the same.  Figuring out that difference will likely drive you insane.Likewise, every new gem created from Bundler has a gemspec that shells out to git at least once.  So, if you have a dependency on a gem sourced from git in your Gemfile, you get to pay that cost on every app load.  And if you end up somehow getting different results on different machines, then you're not really running the same thing, which seems odd to me for a dependency management tool.* It's slow:Gem installation has gotten a lot faster since the early days.  And dependency resolution has gotten better as well.  So, I'm not saying no work is being done here, but it is still slow.  This is a complaint that is always levied at maven, too, so Bundler certainly isn't unique in this regard and I'd argue it got faster in a much shorter timeframe than maven did, so that's promising.* It was designed for MRI:This one may be unfair since I don't use rbx, but bundler wasn't really built with JRuby in mind.  ""bundle exec"" is used everywhere now and it forks a process.  Forking the JVM is anything but light.  The solution is to use binstubs, which avoid the forking.  But also means you can't really use both JRuby and MRI in the same codebase.I really hope that Cargo learns from some of the pitfalls of Bundler.  It seemed like Bundler didn't really learn from the pitfalls of other package managers.  I wasn't involved with any of the design decisions, so I certainly don't want to say it was pulled together haphazardly.  But it also seemed to overlook problems that tools like maven had solved over the past decade.  I'm sure a fair bit of that had to do with the underlying rubygems system, but the distinction is also a bit moot from the user perspective."

In addition to hearing their arguments in the courtroom, they read the same patent law publications as the lawyers, hire young patent lawyers to clerk for them, and are invited to speak at events organized by the patent bar.Moreover, the prestige of the Federal Circuit itself is directly tied to the prominence of patent law in the American legal system. If the Federal Circuit had followed the stricter rules in place before the court was created, patent law might have remained a legal backwater, receiving little attention from either the legal profession or the general public. That, of course, would have made the Federal Circuit a less prestigious place to work.

Thinking like this may be useful as a means of encouraging hope when all hope is lost, but Bitcoin is nowhere near there yet.  Most of all this kind of talk smacks of deep desperation - ""why won't people love me?""I understand fully why one might feel so desperate.  Bitcoin may have the potential to be truly revolutionary.  Bitcoin solves the problem of orchestrating an international currency in a manner that limits the implementation details to the design, not banking/payment industry/political types who historically - for one reason or another - end up building in significant rigidities to the system.It doesn't take a PhD in Economics to see the potential benefits of eradicating PayPal and consumer banks (although it may take one to see the potential pitfalls).  More than this though, Bitcoin opens the door to truly free capital flow.  It is possible to work in the Western world for a month or two and move, say, far East, and live like a king on the savings for a year or more.  Why can't we just buy the stuff over there cheaply and consume it at home?  One major reason is the rigidities in capital flow - it is hard, risky business in the current system.  As a large company in a Bitcoin world you don't have to worry about a great class of risks of international trade, dumping money into the Cambodian economy is no longer a question of FX risk and ""can I get it back out?""This is a great step forward on the way to homogenising international capital stores i.e. ceteris paribus, rich people buy where things are cheapest, like in Cambodia, thereby flowing capital to, and driving up prices in, Cambodia.  Cambodians get richer and the West gets poorer.  Bitcoin has the vague potential to be the great equalizer.We have seen some evidence of this at work in the EU with the Euro, if you look past the troubling dynamics of transition.  Imagine how very different the US would be if every state had a different currency and payment processing rules, the diversity in income would be profound.An educated economist will see a great many problems with this utopian vision, but will likely agree the aim is noble and that the basis - Bitcoin - is the closest thing we have so far to a workable solution.Bitcoin may be as revolutionary as the fanboys want it to be, even if they don't understand why.  My personal thought is that Bitcoin will soon be seen as the thing that started it all, but the solution won't be Bitcoin itself. There are too many problems - no matter how many times you read that a fixed supply currency is the greatest thing since sliced bread, it really isn't.  It's also woefully easy to steal and the mining/verification mechanism is far too resource intensive and encouraging of looney speculation making its value at any point in time completely impossible to reason about.If you love BTC today, don't spout bullshit strings of meaningless words in some grandiose display of being ahead of the times.  Make it stronger and better because if you don't history will judge this whole thing very severely in 10 years time, when it really is just a way of buying drugs and hitmen."

2237,3364,0.6931471805599453,2.0,"The prices of things are not what they are worth, but what the market will bear.The 30 year mortgage allows a rich man to outbid you on the home that you want to buy to live in, a property that he has no personal interest in, so that you can pay interest on the money you only had to borrow so that it could not be loaned to someone else, such that they could afford to pay more than you.  That money pumped into the market only serves to raise prices.  Houses are built larger and more expensively than they otherwise would be because the buyers are able to pay more.If there were no mortgage loans available, the market would be producing a greater number of cheaper homes for sale, and a greater number of rental homes for investors, with more economic separation between those markets.  The rich man outbidding you for property would have to actually assume ownership of it, and would shoulder some risk of carrying vacant rental units.  Venturing into property-owner-land as a rentals investor would evoke a nasty NIMBY response.Believe me when I say that it is possible for every person in America to own their own home, even with just a single minimum wage job for the whole household.  But it isn't bloody likely, thanks to mortgage lending, zoning laws, and building and occupancy codes that completely eliminate entire classes of low-cost housing as either unprofitable for developers or outright illegal.This same phenomenon is now occurring in higher education, wherein loans inflate the price, the product remains essentially the same, and the buyer is saddled with an enormous burden of debt.  Debt is a trap laid by the wily for the foolish.  But it persists because the practice nestles snugly into a Nash equilibrium.  The practice is not at an absolute maximum, but neither player alone can improve his position by making a different move.The only way for the erstwhile borrower to win is to form a cartel able to punish anyone who takes a loan to pay for a good or service too scarce to supply everyone in the cartel.  In other words, non-rich folks win by regulating the hell out of lending, to reduce the number and amount of loans available."

I'll just put a big comment here, and hopefully everyone can see it.@stronglikedan: I don't have plans for extending the core (in fact, keeping it small and modular is a major focus point for me). I do have a list of things I want to tackle next (see the roadmap page), but I'll most likely release them separately from core.@hcho: re: integrating w/ jQuery: see the integrating w/ other libraries page in the guide section. There's a simple example w/ select2 there.@abjorn: those are excellent points. Re: turing completeness: my take is that things like good error messages in the view layer are more important than trying to prevent people from doing stupid things (that's what code reviews are for). Re: Bindings: I'm most familiar w/ Angular ones and yes, their bidi-bindings are really convenient, but they fail in some 5-10% of the use cases for me (either by being too aggressive or not expressive enough). So, that's a conciseness vs power trade-off in design from my personal experience. Re: templating, you can take the model-level utilities and integrate w/ other templating libraries. I do provide some comparisons w/ React and a few other frameworks in the misc section of the guide, as well as design rationales in the main guide page. TL;DR I use other frameworks full-time and I've done homework before I settled on the current implementation :)@hanburglar I do provide a tool to convert HTML to Mithril (although not automated yet), see the ""useful tools"" page.@timmiwil: you're right, jQuery is not MVC (I mention this in the comparisons page). The point is that with idiomatic jQuery, the app developer is responsible for knowing when to use .text() instead of .html(), whereas with, say, idiomatic Angular, that's not a concern, ever. jQuery ""templating"" tends to get pretty hard to audit as widgets become more complex (see select2 source code, for example)@tzaman: I do contribute to Angular and other projects that I use as time permits (mostly bug reports)@BaconJuice: it's a side project, but a scratch-an-itch one that I work on pretty much every night.

But it worked pretty well, and only took about a day and a half to hack together, with realtime multiplayer and chat using socket.io.Obviously you're going to run into things that Angular is not really ideal for, but we are trying to make it do what it does very, very well, so in the future it should be suitable for pretty much any mobile or desktop app.---This sounds like evangelism, which is not my intent, you're absolutely right about what you're saying, but it's true, sometimes a framework works (and saves a ton of time) that you'd otherwise spend hacking together something awful.

It makes sense, from some standpoints. The experience offline wouldn't be what the game developers wanted it to be. SimCity on the other hand, was never developed to be online-only. The reason it was is because EA got greedy, and everyone saw right through it.Now, should apps have an offline mode? Yeah, if at all possible. Let's take Google Play Music as one example. By default, it's a streaming service. But if I lose connectivity I still want to listen to my music, so I can download the songs locally. Now, I just found out the other day that these files aren't downloaded locally forever, so when I left a service area my music stopped even though I had downloaded it previously. Frustrating to no end.So yeah, if the app should have an offline mode and it makes sense to have an offline mode, don't neglect to put one in just because you want complete control.

American people - which we'll broadly define as the ""middle class"" who statistically speaking don't have these tech skills - don't want this. Why would they want foreigners taking their jobs? It makes no sense. Thus they will vote, or have political influence, tending to enact policy that is tough on immigration.Founder visas for tech companies with the intention of creating jobs does not change this, because it creates tech jobs. Middle class America can't fulfill this in meaningful-enough numbers for there to be any positive political influence.""Let us show you what we can do with 100 visas.  This will be measurable, and in 5 years, we can tell you exactly how many jobs get created.""This won't matter much until jobs get created in large enough numbers for the middle class. What's important though will be (and it's hard to tell if this is the case) a ""trickle-down"" effect, where these relatively small number of tech jobs created lead to the creation of other jobs that have a meaningful impact. EDIT - an example that comes to mind is Homejoy, which creates more maid jobs... but boy oh boy can this sort of thing sound like inequality (""let foreign founders come in to make web services turning Americans into maids!"").Think about it - even if a new Google pops up in the next 5 years - that's 25K jobs. Drop in the ocean. 2.2M jobs were created in 2012; let's say in 5 years 10M jobs are created. 25K new tech jobs for a new Google represents a difference of 0.25%. I guess that's something - but how many of those 25K jobs will be filled by American citizens?In short - there's absolutely no reason not to have a founder visa like proposed. That would be sweet. But from the policy makers' perspectives, it doesn't look like there's a compelling enough reason to change the status quo. If anything it's just easy to paint as ""let rich investors bring in foreign engineers to build new websites and apps"". Doesn't really resonate.Feel free to point out flaws in this argument, it would probably help the OP's cause.

2473,1034,0.0,1.0,"I've worked on two large applications that would both benefit from Clean Architecture and they don't feel like outliers, they feel like the natural progression from any MVC framework to an app of significant complexity.The first was a very large PHP app that ran a fundraising website that processed millions of dollars in donations. It grew organically over time and there was need to change database structure or swap out whole modules of the infrastructure like the site search. It was mostly untestable and really could benefit some automated testing.Over time the app was moved to a Ruby web API with Sinatra with a decent Service layer with great test coverage. It's been a massive improvement over what was there originally and moved towards more Clean Architecture principles over time. It never went full Clean Architecture because getting team buy-in was difficult and until you feel the pain of a complex, monolithic codebase with minimal tests and a few botched late night deploys, it is hard to feel the pain that Clean Architecture solves.The second app I've seen that would benefit from Clean Architecture is a Rails app that is pretty vanilla Rails. Normal MVC and all that. Lots of ORM and so on. The tests ran slow and over time the required reporting complexity made the database queries slow and terrible. We've pulled things into a service layer and presenters which helps a bit, but doesn't solve everything. Now we are moving the app reporting into a very functional, immutable approach where we calculate and cache everything all at once in the background. We are only using the models for basic CRUD and for easily pulling out our data structure from the DB, which is then handed to a bunch of functions which calculate everything. It's very much a functional core, mutable shell approach. Even still, this isn't a fully Clean Architecture approach, but it's a lot closer, and it solves a lot of the problems that default Rails MVC doesn't.Clean Architecture is probably best thought of as something people move towards over time as they feel the pain of not having it. Once you feel that pain, it is completely reasonable to want to start your projects clean and keep them that way, but good luck convincing other developers to join you if they haven't felt the pain."

And your tests should all run in less than a second. It's pretty sweet from a purely technical standpoint. Obvious Status has done that with ruby, but I could see the same thing being done in Java, C#, or even C++.I'm not sure why all the rails people are blogging about this kind of architecture seemingly all at once, but it's not new. It's pretty much where you end up when your standard MVC codebase gets out of hand on a reasonably complex project. Uncle Bob spoke over 2 years ago at Ruby Midwest about this and has blogged about it since then. Obvious came out last January and there were a few people talking about it since then, but not many.The real struggle with this kind of structure is that it goes against the standard Rails patterns and ecosystem. DHH doesn't like it and frankly he's right. It goes against the whole spirit of Rails. It doesn't fit in with Rails. Sidenote, DHH originally called it the worst code he's ever seen attached to Rails, so it's got that going for it.If you go down the path of clean architecture (in any of its forms), you are going to have to convince your team of Rails devs to stop using Rails as they know it. Most Ruby or Rails devs don't want or see the need for this kind of structure. That is okay. We had to build a lot of things to make building Obvious apps in Ruby more awesome, but it's an uphill battle. Other languages give you things like interfaces and method parameter type checking as part of the language and will even check them at compile time.Clean Architecture is great, but I think it's going to lead developers away from Ruby and Rails, at least for the core API portion of their app. I really don't know what language most developers will land on, but it will probably have a compiler, it will probably support functional programming and immutability, it might support OOP, and it will probably be on the JVM.

2514,1420,0.0,1.0,"> In the skydiver's LIF under the conditions above, the first particle (the lower particle) would always be moving in the positive x direction in the LIF slower than the second (upper) particle, regardless of the skydiver's speed relative to the Earth, and regardless of the second particle's speed relative to the Earth (i.e. it doesn't need to be escaping).I'm responding to this separately because it was easier than trying to cram this plus my other responses into one post. If you are going to talk about what is or is not the same in the skydiver LIF and the LIF falling through the black hole's horizon, you have to first make sure the initial conditions are set up the same. Here's how you would do that:(1) The LIF is in free fall, i.e., the astronaut/skydiver who is at rest in the LIF is freely falling in the gravitational field of some central body.(2) At time t = 0 in the LIF, the astronaut/skydiver meets an outgoing light ray. (In the LIF falling through the black hole's horizon, this outgoing light ray is the horizon; in the skydiver LIF, it's just whatever outgoing light ray happens to be passing him at t = 0. Within the LIFs, there is no way to distinguish the two.)(3) At some time t = minus epsilon in the LIF, the astronaut/skydiver releases a probe that flies outward at nearly the speed of light. (This is a key point that I don't think you understand: the initial condition in the LIF is that the relative velocity of the probe and the astronaut/skydiver must be the same. It is not that the probe's initial velocity is escape velocity. ""Escape velocity"" is a global concept, not a local concept; it has no meaning within the LIF. It so happens that, in the LIF falling through the black hole horizon, the first probe gets launched at a velocity that, globally, is just sufficient for it to escape to infinity, whereas in the skydiver LIF, the probe's initial velocity is way, way more than needed for it to escape; but there's no way to tell that from within the LIF.)(4) At some time t = plus epsilon in the LIF, the astronaut/skydiver releases a second probe that flies outward at a speed even closer to the speed of light than the first probe.These conditions are perfectly possible to set up in both LIF's (the skydiver LIF and the LIF falling through the black hole's horizon), and within the LIF's, there is no way to tell which LIF you are in; every observation within the LIF will be the same for both. The second probe will move closer to the first probe (while they are both within the LIF); but the second probe will be falling behind the light ray that passes the astronaut/skydiver at t = 0.It's true that, once all these objects exit the LIF, things will be very different in the two cases. In the skydiver case, the outgoing light ray will catch up with and pass the first probe. In the black hole horizon case, it won't. But there's no way to tell that from within the LIF.It's also true that the r coordinates of these objects behave very differently, even within the LIF. In the skydiver case, all three of the objects that are moving outward (the first probe, the light ray, and the second probe) are increasing their r coordinates (and rather rapidly at that). In the black hole case, the first probe has (very slowly) increasing r, the light ray (the horizon) has constant r, and the second probe has (very slowly) decreasing r. But as I said in the other post I made in response to your latest, the r coordinate is a global coordinate, not a coordinate in the LIF; and there is no law of physics that says the relationship between local coordinates within an LIF and global coordinates must be the same for every LIF. In fact, it obviously can't be, because the whole point of the equivalence principle is that LIFs that look the same locally can occur in parts of spacetime that look very different on a global scale."

The r coordinate is a global coordinate, not a coordinate in the LIF; so as soon as you talk about the r coordinate, you are not just talking about the LIF, you are talking about the relationship between the LIF and a global coordinate chart. And there is no law of physics that says that relationship must be the same for every LIF. In fact that relationship is very different for the skydiver LIF as compared to the LIF that is falling through the horizon of a black hole. So any reasoning you do based on the assumption that that relationship is the same for both is simply wrong.> Of course in the skydiver's frame you wouldn't use terms like ""global coordinate chart""As soon as you talk about the r coordinate, you are using a global coordinate chart, whether you realize it or not.

2516,8678,0.0,1.0,"Since you're keeping it short, I will as well. I don't think it's worth discussing the blog post because it's too vague and it makes too many misstatements about what relativity says. That's why I tried to take out what I saw as the essential points and put them into puzzles that were properly stated. If you can't or won't discuss the puzzles as I presented them, I won't be able to give much of a response. All I can do is point out some particular items that seem to me to capture the mistakes you and the blog post author are making.The cloud of particles is demanded by GR to be splitting in two along the horizonThis is wrong; GR ""demands"" no such thing. The blog post's author has misunderstood GR in this respect. See below.When you talk about ""global coordinate chart"" and a ""lightlike curve"" you're being unnecessarily complex, I sayAnd I say that you are making a big mistake here, because a proper understanding of those concepts and how they relate to the LIF centered on the horizon is crucial to properly understanding and stating what GR says about this scenario. You'll see several examples of this below.one basic prediction of GR as it relates to the horizon, namely that everything below the horizon moves inexorably inward toward the singularityThat means everything below the horizon must decrease its r coordinate in the global coordinate chart. It does not mean that everything below the horizon must decrease its x coordinate in the LIF. Remember: the horizon itself is the line t = x in the LIF; i.e., the horizon is moving in the positive x direction in the LIF at the speed of light, and it passes through the origin of the LIF at t = 0, x = 0. So a ""cloud"" particle that is at some negative x value at t = 0 in the LIF will be inside the horizon, and a ""cloud"" particle that is at some positive x value at t = 0 in the LIF will be outside the horizon; and it is perfectly possible for the first particle (inside the horizon) to be moving in the positive x direction in the LIF faster than the second particle. And this can be true even if the second particle (the one outside the horizon) is moving at ""escape velocity"". And it can also be true even though the first particle's r coordinate is decreasing and the second particle's r coordinate is increasing. My previous post gave more details on why those statements are true.Oh, and one other thing: what does ""toward the singularity"" mean in the LIF? Which direction is the singularity in? The answer is, it's in the positive t direction--i.e., it's in the future. So any object in the LIF is moving ""toward the singularity"" as far as the LIF is concerned, since all objects move towards the future. There is no way to tell, from within the LIF, which objects are going to ultimately hit the singularity and which ones are not. That's a global concept.To prove the blog wrong you need to show that the cloud doesn't split in two, that all the cloud's particles can in fact move outward in formation.My previous posts (plus all the ones in the earlier HN thread I linked to, plus what I posted on PF) have already done that, multiple times.

Italy was also in a similar state of micro-nations until WW1.What would be interesting, rather than borders, would be to have: \n- populations by origin\n- density maps\nso that you could see the ""normands"" (from Hungarian descent) penetrating France until they were allowed to settle in Normandy for fear they would bring down the Kingdom.

There is always an arbitrarily short duration of time available in any LIF, so frame X's size in spacetime is not an issue.When you talk about ""global coordinate chart"" and a ""lightlike curve"" you're being unnecessarily complex, I say. We're talking a simple inertial frame of special relativity here, plus one basic prediction of GR as it relates to the horizon, namely that everything below the horizon moves inexorably inward toward the singularity.

2860,8917,1.3862943611198906,4.0,"In these types of situations, it's usually pretty difficult to come to solid conclusions about the chain of events this early. My initial take?It's not uncommon for business owners to rely heavily on non-employees for advice, even in the day-to-day operations. Spouses are especially common. What confuses me is that the wife, as portrayed, seems a bit irrational--if not delusional. There's a big difference between even vocal trusted advisors, and the sort of power the wife described herself as having.So much so that I think there's a third possible interpretation: the quotes are accurate, given by a wife that genuinely believes her statements even though they have no basis in reality. This sort of delusion, in varying degrees, is quite common across the population. We convince ourselves of something--in this case, the wife that she has power in the Github organization--and then attempt to reduce the cognitive dissonance that arrises from the belief and the evidence to the contrary. As time goes on, we try harder and harder to justify those irrational beliefs.It's entirely possible that there's no truth whatsoever to the wife's words, but that the wife genuinely believed them in spite of it. And that Julie Horvath is entirely accurate in detailing the conversation and the implied hostility she felt from the founder and his wife. So now, not only do you have to determine whether the conversation took place, but also whether the power the wife alleged existed in the first place. Unfortunately for Github, even if the wife never had that power, the wife was still able to contribute to a hostile work environment and that can have significant legal ramifications even though she wasn't an employee.Friends you go out for drinks with to talk about life and work slowly transform into ""spies"" who keep you informed of what's happening in the office under the guise of gossip. Curiously taking a peek at an open chat tab on the husband's laptop becomes ""access."" Commenting on whether you liked a potential hire you met earlier becomes ""responsibility over hires."" Love for your husband and concern for his work becomes an overprotective desire to shield him from harm.Given how rapidly Github has grown, the idea that any trusted non-employee, wife or not, would have that sort of power and influence described seems absurd. Hell, for a while it seemed as though they announced a new hire daily. Far too many for one non-employee, no matter how often she went into the office, to have that sort of power. Especially when most were technical positions.Time will tell, but for now, more information is needed. Anyhow, I suppose I took issue with the phrase ""undocumented employee"" and ran off on a tangent :). The wife needn't have been an employee at all to have helped cause a shitstorm."

There's no basis for special treatment--in fact, depending on how it's handled, such special treatment would, at a minimum, place the company in a potentially perilous legal situation with future cases.One of the major ideas behind suspending employees for investigations is to eliminate their ability to influence the investigation. Also, it's a immediate precautionary measure to prevent the behavior from continuing should the complaint be found to be valid. In that sense, it protects the employer by keeping them at a distance in the short-term. They can also point to it in the press and in future legal proceedings (if any) as part of a strategy of showing that they took the complaint seriously from the beginning."

2894,2566,1.791759469228055,6.0,"I still think Dorian is very likely the Satoshi Nakamoto we're looking for. My basis for this is the fact that Dorian is very desperately trying to hide something, and it is evident in his denials, which contain claims that are very hard to believe. Three of the them stand out to me: His claim that he did not hear of bitcoin until February of this year, his claim that he thought the reporter was talking about ""bitcom"" and not bitcoin, and that the accusation of him being the creator of bitcoin has damaged his job seeking prospects. All three are nonsense claims and very hard to believe.There's no way an out of work computer engineer could not have heard of bitcoin until so recently unless he was living in a cave. The hype of bitcoin was quite large and pretty much anyone computer literate would have heard of it, especially a guy who's name is Satoshi Nakamoto. As to his claim of thinking he was talking about ""bitcom"" not bitcoin, well according to the Newsweek article, Dorian was first informed of bitcoin through email, which means he likely could not have confused that word with anything else. Furthermore, he claimed he was told by his own son about it before he talked to the AP reporter where the confusion arose. Which means he has at least two clear-cut occasions where he would have been corrected beforehand. Finally, his claim of the ""accusation"" hurting his job prospects are quite silly, since he's been out of work for more than a decade. The argument makes very little sense, nor does it seem plausible being accused of creating bitcoin at all would hurt your job prospects. All in all, it's clear that Dorian is not being honest, and certainly you cannot trust his words at all.Finally, if you believe he is the creator of bitcoin, then you must also realize he is a very intelligent man and should very easily write coherent English that could pass for a younger person, and then mask it in person when accused. On the other hand, he probably can't, no matter how smart he is, completely defeat logical analysis when is directly fingered. Plus, it's pretty rare to be this vehement in your denials unless there actually is some truth to the accusation (see Lance Armstrong, Roger Clemens, etc.).

""Windows developers"" also means all the AAA PC(+console) game developers (the most diehard C++ users). Linux still is not a relevant platform there.This is not correct. Mac OSX is very much a first class platform supported as well as (or better than) Linux, and the ""wait until the language is stable"" is not the attitude that is being taken: firstly, every single changeset is required to pass tests on Windows to be merged (i.e. Windows is being regarded as first class too, even if there's a few lacking areas), and secondly, people are working on it, although slowly, such as the removal of the dependency on GCC's C++ runtime.> A package manager may belong to a Linux development environment for Rust, but the language itself and its library handling should be completely independent of it.

3219,1459,0.0,1.0,"Liberalism is a really broad idea. In general, it's based on the principles of achieving liberty and equality for everyone. There lots of differing (often incompatible) views about how to do that.>  While they include policies on populist measures such as internet filters which appeal to their young voter baseI think that's a really unfair position to take on their policy here; it trivializes the effort they (in particular, Scott Ludlam) are putting into it. [0] They've fought more than just the Internet filter - Scott Ludlam has introduced a bill [1] that would end mass surveillance by Australian intelligence agencies, he's continuously made motions in the Senate to inquire about mass surveillance, and made speeches about the importance of whistleblowers in a democracy.Look, sure, I would agree that the Greens party could do more. Ending mass surveillance and supporting Internet freedom aren't a central tenet of their platform, but that's their right (I'm not a Greens member). It's why I vote for the Pirate Party in the senate (and I would vote for them in the lower house if they had a representative in my seat). I plan to volunteer for the Pirate Party at the next election, if I'm in Australia then.If you take issue with a party taking a particular position to appeal to a certain voter base, then you take issue with representative democracy in general.> They were a large backer of government regulation of the pressThe Australian Greens believe that:- Freedom of the press and effective, affordable and accessible media and communications systems are integral to the functioning of a successful democratic society.- Australia must have an independent regulatory framework for media, communications and advertising.- Net neutrality is important for an open internet.- Documents placed in the public domain by government should be accessible with free non-proprietary software, and public data should be made available in open, inter-operable formats.- The government should lead by example and embrace open source and open standards.That said, if you believe that government is anathema to liberty (I don't), you would consider any law relevant to any part of the press as being ""regulation"". I think these aims of the Greens make sense (mostly):- Diversity of both opinion and ownership of media across Australia and a strict limitation on the number of media outlets an individual entity can own or control.- Truth in political advertising legislated.- Individuals protected from defamation actions designed to stifle participation in public debates.- Effective regulation of the digital games industry to ensure children are not exposed to excessive violence or sexual content.My support of that last aim wavers on the meaning of ""effective regulation"". I do support a rating system for games to help parents choose, but I wouldn't support censoring anything outright (I don't think the Greens would, either).> [the Greens] frequently talk of population capsSource?> They even have an ex-soviet for a Federal Senator.I really don't care. I only care about their policies and their actions - and I mostly agree with them.> There is no true liberal party in Australia, especially not the Greens.It's really useful to be able to come to terms with views that differ to your own. Your version of liberty isn't the only version of liberty.In my opinion, the Greens are far and away the most liberal major party in Australian politics. They may not align with your view of ""true liberty"", but that doesn't mean they're not liberal. They very clearly support liberty (in words and actions), certainly more so than Labor or the Liberals/Nationals. The Pirate Party agrees with me here: the Greens are at the top of their preferences.> Having said that, the new LDP senator will be worth watching to see what is said and what is voted for.There are a few policies of the LDP that I support, that few other parties care about. I support abolishing most federal departments and reforming the constitution to give states legal autonomy, because I believe smaller governments are more democratic and less susceptible to corruption. I support privatizing Australia Post, electricity generation, and bus and ferry transport, because those industries are open to competition, and their profit motives align with the public good. They do have a lot of policies supporting liberty that I agree with.Unfortunately, I think their beliefs in how to achieve a free and equal society are, quite plainly, bonkers. I think there are lot of industries where the profit motive does not align with the public good (education, health, media, prison, military), or where competitiveness is intrinsically nonexistent (rural telecommunications infrastructure, metro train transport). I would always support private competition in those industries, but I think it's important to have publicly-owned offerings to provide a lower-bound in service and quality.Furthermore, I believe there are government regulations that directly decrease liberty, but indirectly increase liberty much more. Workplace regulations (minimum wage, discrimination, safety, training), gambling, international trade (to some extent), banking, and drugs (control, not criminalization) fall into this category.On taxation: I believe we should tax our super-profitable industries so that we can share the wealth we have now with future generations, and so that they don't create an imbalance in the rest of the economy.A major reason I support the Pirate Party is that their entire process is really inclusive: they have a well-maintained wiki, an updated blog, and an active IRC channel. Their policy development process is open and democratic. They're like the Labor party of the 21st Century.In contrast, most other political parties' processes are closed and private - including the LDP. It's unfortunate that for all the LDP's espousing of liberty and direct democracy, they don't seem to keen to create a democratic environment for their own party.[0]: http://scott-ludlam.greensmps.org.au/prism[1]: http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislati...[2]: http://greens.org.au/policies/media-communications"

We stopped the Internet filter, we pirate more than any other country, and we have Green party representatives in both houses of the national parliament.I think a Bill of Rights is non-democratic in Westminster-judicial societies. Whereas in the US the judicial branch is somewhat accountable to the people, in the UK, Canada and Australia, the people's will is only expressed in parliament. So, if the Australian parliament amended our constitution with a bill of rights, it would be handing power from our elected representatives to our non-elected High Court judges.Furthermore, bills of rights are only superficial in protecting rights - they are always subject to the whim of the culture and society in which they operate. Canada has a bill of rights [0] supposedly protecting freedom of speech as a fundamental right, yet ""discriminatory speech"" is illegal (e.g. a comedian discriminating against homosexuals [1]).[0]: http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-12.3/page-1.html[1]: http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2013/06/20/comedian-dinged-for...Sure, ""discriminatory speech"" has been ruled illegal in Australia too [2], but my point is: what's the point of a bill of rights, then?[2]: http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/09/29/bolt-decision-irresponsi...Or, another example, look at how well the US' Fourth Amendment is protecting Americans from mass surveillance. I would posit that the reason the US has maintained more freedoms than other countries isn't thanks to its Bill of Rights, but thanks to their cultural belief in the importance of liberty. (or maybe its their distrust of government oppression of liberty? I can't tell)So, as an Australian, I have no problem with not having a bill of rights. If we become a republic, and our High Court judges are then accountable to us? Maybe. But I'll want to hear from respected law professors before making my mind up.

Only now you're saved the callback spaghetti.Node.js advocates are literally peddling callback spaghetti as an advantage because ""it lets you write much faster applications with ease"", yet Haskell's threads and blocking semantics blow any Node.js out of the water by an order of magnitude. (Check out Mighttp/Warp or Go's net/http vs. Node.js.) I come across as cynical because that is sad. It feels like we're travelling back in time, not forward.The only thing that makes node.js ""good"" when it comes to threading and async is that it doesn't require synchronization as there is no concurrency.

Let's take the example:    form.length.$error.float\n\nThe name form, albeit horribly chosen in this case, represents the parent form's identifier in angular (the form's name attribute). It would've made more sense to use  or something more insightful so you could more easily see the name matching from HTML to JS.$error is simply the representation of any form validation errors that may have occurred. It's standard in angular, and there's plenty of documentation. Just google for ""angularjs form validation"" and you'll find a million resources at your disposal.form.length.$error.float is checking if an error exists for the validation rule float. Given the limited amount of code in the sample, we'd have to arbitrarily assume that the ""smart-float"" directive is implicitly setting a custom validation rule via:    ngModel.$setValidity('float')\n\nI'll have to agree to disagree regarding pattern usage and dependency injection. They do have a place, and it tends to be in larger applications which become a burden to maintain as your application grows. To be quite honest, I believe angular brought a simplicity to DI that has yet to be seen in many other frameworks.

The default behavior when you install the package is that A, B, and C have copies of all their dependencies (so if all 3 depend on D, you get 3 copies of D), and so forth all the way down.

You vendor all dependencies.No, I'm saying imagine you have an app, which depends on pkgs a and b. a depends on c1.1, b depends on c1.5, but this is documented nowhere in the code because the import statements simply say import ""c"". This is the default and encouraged behaviour currently with golang and go get. go get a fetches the latest of c.You then vendor a,b,c and happily compile your app, which doesn't work because the version of c you got when you vendored was 2.1, which neither a nor b was written against. Maybe your app will fail to build and you fix it, maybe your app will build but be wrong in subtle ways (say an enum value changed), without explicit versioning you have no idea really.If a and b had a vendored c, you have an even more messy situation as security bugs exist in c1.1 and c1.5, but you don't even know which version you have if you pull in the ac and bc and compile against them, or if you can safely use two versions of c at once, your code uses c2.1 too, etc, etc.Being explicit about versions is helpful for resolving dependency conflicts because it makes it explicit which version was expected at the time of writing, it doesn't magically solve all conflicts, no-one has this completely worked out, but it helps to be as explicit as possible when including other projects, and it is helpful in keeping up to date libraries whilst easily including them, even if you vendor.If you have a large, open ecosystem of constantly evolving libraries, which I think golang should aspire to, it is useful to version them (just as golang itself is versioned)."

The Go packaging system is pretty good, but it isn't perfect, and I'm not convinced vendoring is a viable solution if you're going to be sharing code and collaborating on several open source projects - it's a recipe for lots of incompatible versions with security and other bugs unfixed floating around in different projects, and a lot of confusion from newcomers about the required version of a library because it is not specified anywhere.The current approach works perfectly if you are working in-house, willing to do your own dependency resolution, and are happy to vendor your own dependencies - it's completely reasonable within one company or org to do this. However it fails in more collaborative or open-source environments like libraries shared on github depending on other libraries shared on github. I do think they need version pinning for that (in fact they have version pinning for the language in go get, just not for individual packages), it wouldn't be a large change.For example, in the recent Stripe CTF, people ended up downloading and building different packages locally than those available on the server builds, because there was no clarity on which version was included. That was kind of annoying. It could be solved by vendoring, but then you have other issues in the long-term with relying on other people to keep their pkg dependencies up to date or you can be including two conflicting versions of a third pkg.They've taken an interesting approach in trying to eschew versions (which avoids some problems with dependency resolution), but I'm not sure it is sustainable long-term. Didn't they also try to make golang itself version free initially?"

Here, you've got a base system, and you want to install some piece of software in order to use it.  You want this to be guaranteed, for some reasonable definition of ""guaranteed,"" to work with your existing base system.2. Here, you want to install packages within a segregated environment, and you want those packages to work with any packages previously installed in said environment.  You're probably attempting to do something like recreating your deployment environment locally.It strikes me that there are only two issues preventing the latter from being subsumed by the former.1. Not all package management systems provide a means to have multiple versions of a package/runtime/what-have-you installed at the same time.  Often, this capability is there , but packages need to be specially crafted (unique names, etc.) for it to work.  See Debian's various Ruby and Python runtime packages for example.2. Not all package managers provide a way to install a set of specific package versions in a contained environment which is segregated and requires intention to enter.(Note that I'm ignoring the ""there are different package formats"" issue; I don't think is in practice a huge barrier, and the package maintainers should be involved anyway.)If we could get RPM and YUM to provide those services, then we could remove the vast majority of this duplication.Alternatively, if we all agreed that developers should just use Linux containers as development environments, then all we'd need is upstream to use native OS packages (which is, really folks, not very hard).Can we do that pretty please??"

Does everyone post to Github for the circle jerk of attention?> Ugh, I hate that the term ""circle jerk"" is being applied to ""a place where people share things they have made.""Well, I did not mean to sound superior. I do not think I can code well enough to look down at other people for coding ability.  I just feel that people increasingly, like any social network, will work on projects on Github for attention and the content is questionable or strange. Social is transforming to a place to socialize, and the latter I do not like for Github or anywhere else for enthusiast programming.Recently, I had an idea because I got sick of TinyTinyRSS, a PHP-based feed reader with some good mobile app integration.  I wrote a small README, uploaded a SVG of the MySQL DB structure to get an idea, and had not written any of the Python I described.  I received three stars a week later, and not a single line of code yet.  How does that even make sense?  My point is people go around look for attention without effort.  Yes, I know this describes every social network.  I dislike them.  You can balk at that ironically, because I am here, ostensibly another social network in different orange wrapper.  Nonetheless, the kind of voting and sometimes absurd comment threads in nerd wars, like the whole Node.js commit changing gender and the Joyent employee who lost his job over it, were disgusting.  I understood both sides of that issue, but people were declaring there sides with superfluous commentary in the pull request comments, and the hundred or so comments supporting various views on women and IT and superfluous garbage showed it was a hot topic.  No one wanted to debate the merits of the commit or how to handle the issue as it pertained to the Node community with that specific issue, of course.  It was just an angry Facebookesque flameware on Github.  I hoped I would not see Github turn into that.  I foolishly assumed it would be a long time before I saw that because, like it or not, computer culture, especially open source stuff, is still fringe.It is this that bothers me.  Some people write cutesy meaningless libraries to get attention.  I probably write garbage, code far worse than anyone of that ilk.  But what I do not like is the stress Github is now turning the celebration of open programming and collaboration into, merely a celebrity contest. I cannot find the talk by one of the Node guys talking about how he started to be really affected by the number of stars he received on projects (and this is a guy that had projects in Node with sometimes three or four digits in his star count! I never broke more than 1, on anything).  He said it ruined his focus drive and he had to re-center himself.My point here, whether you disagree or not, is that a social network for coding does not mean a socializing network where it is playground for different cliques, with random bullies and popular kids looking down at you.  Github is not that yet, but my point was that prioritizing attention-getting when working in open source projects seems quite contrary to me.Ask Richard Hipp."

Thus, it has been single-core only for many years later, because Xavier and the core team did not think SMP implementation was a priority, and have not been asked since.Granted, I very seemingly little about this.

The caveat is Shen has been ported to other runtimes, namely, Python and Ruby. But SBCL is the preferred runtime layer for Shen's crazy type system.Typed Racket - It is a Scheme, and people will throw things at me, but I think it safe to say static types for this subset prove Lisp family languages have the potential for robust static typing systems you hint at.TL;DR: Strong static typing is not common (pun intended), but it is possible.

Popularity is nice, but I post to Github because it is a public place, not to gain popularity.  You will never see my code there, I am sure.  Most Github repos I stumble upon are through other media and social networks mentioning cool stuff, just like HN.  I use plenty of self-hosted tools and I respect those people just the same, maybe even more because they got their somehow without recommendations on the side of a page or trending repo notifcations and email updates.However, what do I wish I saw more of, like a lot now that I read up on Common Lisp, is people mirror aggressively on repo.or.cz, Github, Bitbucket and the like, when their site goes down or they lose interest.  Github makes that easy, but we should not throw out the baby with the bath water: Git and tools like it encourage this simple reproduction of effort.  I love open source because it is the only human organization I am familiar with that makes this and transparency such an important mantra (I am biased).In short, I will never get attention, but I hope to get understanding.  I understand some people contribute for different reasons, but if you are on Github to get attention, the rest of ""normalized"" society is laughing at us anyway.I work in an IT department, and when I mention Github and source code and different languages, people stare at me like an alien.

3639,8208,1.0986122886681098,3.0,"On a somewhat related tangent, but a tangent just the same, Ada came to my mind because people in another thread about avionics in relation to the Malaysia Air Flight were debating the efficacy and/or safety of Ada versus a language like, for example, Haskell.When I looked into Ada and memory management, out of curiosity, I did not find a lot of information about pointers.  Or a garbage collection system, and casual reading confirms that Ada has a less manual version of pointers (from what I gather) and manual memory management, and no garbage collection.  Given its syntax and semantics, which remind me very, very vaguely of Haskell (which I am sure is bound to insult someone on HN, specifically Haskellers), I could not imagine this as a systems language.  Then again, even though I am ignorant of such things and do not know C/C++ (the latter I only took briefly in undergrad, and I have mixed reactions), I am product of the C/C++ generations and the stand of the shoulders of Unix and Linux giants, as I have looked into computer science and Linux application source code in attempt to understand.  Not even write the code mind you, just understand.  Perhaps others were exposed to Pascal and BLISS, so the alternative perspectives made it seem possible.  I do not have that perspective, so I feel dazed and confused by alternative offerings when reading them.  I get the idea generally, but still whisper to myself with a concerned ""How!?"", even though it should be more obvious.In short, I cannot really conceive of manual memory management without pointers and pointer arithmetic as it presented in C and/or C++.  I was terrible at it, granted, but everything else I see from Rust to other system languages which promise a systems language without GC and offer some equivalent of memory management done manually do not click.  They seem foreign and impossible because I have always assumed, for better or worse, C is the way you interface with a modern PC or embedded system by managing each and every pointer, or you are on your way to assembly and then memory is one of many complicated underpinnings you must understand intimately, not just the must troublesome one.But I am an amateur programmer.  I recently the saw the threads on FORTH.  I want to look because, as much as I ""know computers"" the idea of this kind of very low level stack language is very foreign to me, just from looking at it I feel odd and not sure how it could possibly work.  The same would be true of writing low level code in Haskell.  I like it a lot, for all its beauty and warts, but I have just assumed you must learn to manage such things manually and in an ugly fashion a la C/C++ to learn system management in a programming language in our generation, and no amount of screaming or holding your breath until in the red face will change that.However, a lot of this is conditioning.

Think about all the movies you've seen since the 1980s, the shows you've watched, the books you've read.

It whispers seductively to that part of your brain that lies to you about how important you are. Any story or idea that fills the need to feel different, special, and unique passes through our scrutiny without a second thought. We want to believe it's true even as we examine our motivations for doing so because it's hard wired into our brains.The problem is that this weakness is easily exploited. Writers, motivational speakers, game designers, poets... they're all in the business of hacking our brains. We've been doing such a good job of it since the sixties that our popular culture is unconsciously driven by it.And it manifests as burnout when it clashes with other popular memes like the Protestant Work Ethic. If you just put in a little elbow grease and work harder you will stand out. If you write that amazing library to make programmers' lives easier they will shower you with praise on the Internet and invite you to speak at conferences so that you may shower the masses with your brilliant message.

3688,1829,0.0,1.0,"This blog post expresses little understanding of why these other package managers are used, or even how.They are not supposed to be used to install things under (say) /usr at all. That is up to the platform's package manager. If you do that, it's not the tool but you who is being stupid. If this is a real problem for you, why are you putting the person who does this into sudoers on production machines - I assume or anyway hope it is not a real problem for you.I have any number of command-line tools which depend on recent versions of things, and are not project-specific. I can install them under a prefix that is inside my $HOME.Or when I make a project, I can make a sandbox where the tools get installed.And I can deploy it in a sandbox, not haphazardly depending on system versions of everything.None of these things I am doing to make my life as a developer manageable are harming your ""architecture"" (scripts to run package managers are architecture now?)There are good use cases for platform packages. But every little thing should not be done with them. That adds up to a HUGE waste of time, with no real purpose.When I make projects, I often need them to run against any number of different versions of things. But the most minimal requirement is to be able to use an actually-recent version of a dependency, where the platform you have dictated thinks recent means ""6 years old."" Neither of these can I do with the existing platform packages. So you demand that I make platform packages for every little tool and dependency I may use. Then, everything I want to use has to run against exactly one set of versions. So you are actually asking me to make my own whole-platform upgrades, or never use recent packages. That's not my job, it's not a sane way for me to do my job, and it actually doesn't benefit you at all. It reflects a really profound lack of understanding not only of my job, but actually also of your own job.Then as an author of a library or tool I made available for free, you are demanding that to satisfy you I make packages for several different platforms, each with their own idiosyncrasies and versions of everything, and in fact that I package half the universe for each platform since most of them do not have recent versions of anything - or again only ever use 6 year old dependencies. All so that your job never has to go beyond running the One True Package Manager, whatever you think it is.Then after all this unnecessary pain, your ""solution"" will require me to run an entire fresh VM for each new thing. Because you have stipulated that I have to dump all my dependencies for every project into one big sewer, it is guaranteed that there will be version conflicts.  This is amazingly stupid because the tools already exist to avoid it very easily and people are already using them. And on your side, all you have to complain about is vague bruises to your feelings because not everybody is using the One True Package Manager for every little thing.There is such a thing as a business listening too much to system administrators, when these system administrators do not at all understand software development, because their motivation is to prevent change and have less to do rather than to facilitate development of the business. When you blast this complaint at the whole community, you are asking for time to stand still and for nobody to develop anything new in the entire community. ALL forward progress must halt in order for you to have less work. It's not happening and it shouldn't happen.If you are paid to be a system administrator, please perform your function as a system administrator. Please resolve these problems within the framework of your own company's division of labor. If you have to build packages for your production platform, I'm sorry but that's probably part of your job. If you don't like it, please whine to HR instead of whining to HN.If you think it will be easy to make every language developer use the same package manager as every other language, it should be equally easy to make all the platforms use one package format instead of the arbitrary hell of different ones they are using now. That is going to be your best bet for actually making one true package manager. Good luck."

This in turn causes far too frequent breakage.What we really need is system package managers that can cooperate with their language-specific brethren to get info about packages under other managers' control, direct other managers to install something according to its own rules/methods, and so on.""Hey apt-get, please tell me the status of this Ruby package""\n<>""Hey yum, please install this Go package""\n<>The rules for how to talk to each language-specific package manager shouldn't even need to be very complicated.

Returning structures from functions requires a copy, in this case the array of button states, and copies of them are also created inside of functions like ButtonDebouncer::update. Only one of these state arrays is ever needed, so make only one...The actual matrix-scan loop in HardwareController could also be simplified greatly; this usually just involves shifting a 1 bit through the row/column driver output port register(s) and reading the input port(s). There's no need to turn all the rows/columns off each time, since getting the next col/row is only a matter of changing which one is being driven. Getting the button number shouldn't require a multiplication (I'll admit I was pretty shocked when I saw that!) either, since each iteration of the inner loop is the button after the previous one, so it can be done with one counter.> Mostly USB library stuff, I think. Been a while since I profiled it.I'm more familiar with PS/2 keyboard protocol which is much simpler, but USB shouldn't be that much more complex to send/receive info once everything has been initialised (and as I understand from working with USB controllers in non-keyboard devices, the SIE does much of the actual transfer work in hardware.)> Can you further explain this paragraph? I don't know what you mean by ""unused positions in the key matrix"".There can be row/column combinations which don't have keyswitches at their intersection, but are scanned anyway. You can connect other units so that they act like keyswitches when they send information.> Like I said: I'd have no implement the protocol from scratch, in software.

I agree with the author's view that it is sufficiently complex that it can force you to think about not allocating, i.e. ""should I really be doing this?"" and thus you often arrive at a simpler, more efficient solution than you would if you'd used something like Java and thought ""I'll just create a new X object"". I see this all the time in C code written by programmers who first learnt Java - malloc()'ing and copying objects everywhere, often with an underuse of free() and thus plenty of memory leaks.My personal preference is for not using fixed-length buffers for storing things like (non-static) strings, unless I know for certain that they won't ever grow past a certain length (and document it clearly, so if something ever needs a length check I can go back and find them); strings of user input and other possibly indeterminately long things get documented as ""limited by available memory"" (i.e. they're dynamically allocated) or ""limited to X bytes"" (usually due to a fixed-length buffer somewhere).As a note, the fragment    str = malloc(1 + sizeof ""submenu"");\n    strcpy(str, ""submenu"");\n    return str;\n\ncould be replaced by a single    return strdup(""submenu"");"

The proper way of packaging software source is having it contained in a directory tree with one, public build script (a Makefile, a shell script...) at its root.  One or many build artefacts are generated, which at user's disposal.With language specific build systems, this process gets more complicated.  They disallow the user to arrange their source tree the way they want, customise the build process, and make the whole thing as convenient as running make, or e.g. ./build.sh.  Provided a conventional compiler command (e.g. the cc interface), it is easy to create a Makefile that exploits it.I have had a lot of confusion with Go compiler, when I tried to build and use a checked-in, external package.  Python's pip is quite complicated.  Cabal, can easily be replaced with a bunch of Makefiles.  Binary packages can be supplied as [tar/zip] archives, and users would eventually package them for their OS.  Also, most these package managers are exploited for installing applications, which is problematic.I have not used Rust, but I will try it out.

For instance, several Nokia X Android apps were ported from their WP counterparts using Xamarin - http://blog.xamarin.com/nokia-x-for-csharp/ .My only concerns if this were to happen are,* What happens to Mono on Linux, BSD & OSX? Does Mono simply become a deployment target for mobile devices?* What happens to MonoDevelop?  Will VS be the only way to develop such apps?* What about the web? I'd love to see a Mono port to pNACL or asm.js.

What are you saying isn't?Rape and death threats are not being codified into conference codes of conduct, are not considered to be, by any rational observer, acceptable behavior, and -- let's be perfectly honest -- are not actually strong threats.

I'm not really sure how that's supposed to make you feel unsafe.That perceived offensive is now more important than objective truth, and alone is enough to cause one to be pulled aside at a conference, lose your job, or libel a company or person publicly.That's more than enough to be made to feel unsafe and unwelcome, and ""trigger"" warnings only serve to reinforce the appearance of Orwellian groupthink, with-us-or-against-us, that your position embodies."

4001,1993,1.9459101490553128,7.0,"That's the thing. Your ""unless..."" clause is the key element.As background, I fly a twin engine piston airplane that's pressurized (Beech 58P). Different level of responsibility from a 777-ER (I have only 6 seats, including my own), but many of the same basic design principles apply.My cabin is pressurized by air coming off the turbos (the turbos ""make"" higher than ambient pressure air, and that is fed into the cabin after passing through a restrictor and an intercooler). Turbines (jets and turbo-props) pressurize from bleed air (also high pressure air created in the engine, but via a different physical mechanism.)If I have an engine or turbo failure, I need to be able to isolate the cabin from the smoke/fumes/fire that may be present on that engine. So, I have a red knob that can isolate the cabin from the feed from that side (and another knob that will isolate the other side).Similarly, I have a cabin pressure controller, and on that a cabin dump switch. The controller controls a single outflow valve at the rear of the cabin, about the cross-section of a roll of toilet paper, and there is a second, spring-loaded valve of the same size that's designed to automatically open if the cabin were at risk of over-pressurization.It would be trivial for me to dump the cabin quickly with a single switch. This results in a cabin rate of climb of over 3K feet per minute, which is painful on the ears, and within minutes the cabin will climb to the aircraft altitude. (I test virtually all of the systems annually prior to the annual major maintenance event, such that if a system has failed, I can have it addressed during major maintenance.)Why is there a dump switch at all? Dumping the cabin is a great way to clear the cabin of smoke, so in the event of an electrical fire or smoke, once the situation is contained, I can dump the cabin, venting all the toxic smoke inside to the outside, with a supply of ""clean"" higher-pressure air entering at the front. Once the smoke has cleared, I close the outflow valve to re-pressurize the cabin from the engines.The point of this wall of text is that aircraft are designed assuming that someday something will fail. When it fails, the pilots, assumed to be the ""good guy"", need to have the best chance possible to react.All common, and many uncommon, failures have a specific checklist response, sometimes with initial items from memory. (With an engine on fire, you want to perform the initial response from memory, backing it up later with the written checklist.)No plane is designed to protect the occupants from a pilot intent on killing everyone on board. The pilot has any number of ways to do that, so it's counter-productive to prevent the 99.99% emergencies from being responded to by a well-intentioned pilot in order to prevent the occasional madman from killing all aboard."

The communication overhead will increase the CPU cost of dealing with each request, hurting overall throughput (if you process two requests simultaneously, your latency will explode).In this scenario, it's a simple trade off and thus doesn't seem to fit.

Someone who has never programmed before could look at some vanilla javascript and plead perplexity, but obviously this isn't an indictment of javascript itself. To really make the point, the parent comment would have to show that the learning curve is disproportionately arduous for the payoff at the summit, but reiterations of personal unfamiliarity were offered instead.Jeswin gives no evidence of having made a reasonable attempt to understand Angular (""directives, scopes?""), but more crucially, displays little understanding of the benefits of Angular. DI is criticised as ""a solution looking for a problem"" in the context of javascript, as if dependency injection were a bandaid for not being a dynamic language. DI enables testability, and not even mentioning this advantage, let alone not providing a cogent argument for why the learning curve of DI doesn't justify the gains in testability, is to refuse to participate in the discussion entirely. Directives are similarly dismissed as ""foreign objects,"" which they might be to some, but they're hugely powerful foreign objects that allow arbitrary behaviour to be written declaratively. Not knowing the benefits of Angular obviously contributes greatly to a reluctance to learn it, and perhaps a subsequent rationalisation of this reluctance as being provoked by something intrinsic to the framework.Fittingly, after expressing bewilderment regarding Angular scoping, Jeswin goes on to divide the world into two camps, declaring membership in ""the one which makes me productive with the languages, specs, and standards I already know"", which is about the closest thing to a natural language scoping bug I've come across."

4111,3401,1.0986122886681098,3.0,"We've indirectly measured gravitational waves before. Folks won the 1993 Nobel prize in physics for the observations. The ""Hulse-Taylor"" binary star system is a pair of neutron stars orbiting very close to each other (the pair of neutron stars orbiting each other would fit inside of our own Sun). Because the stars are pulsars it's possible to measure the orbit with extremely high precision over time. One prediction of the theory of gravitational waves is that the emission of gravitational waves actually removes small amounts of energy from an orbital system over time (like a drag force). But normally these amounts are so small as to be inconsequential even over extremely long periods, but with very dense, very massive, very closely orbiting objects the amount is much higher. And the result is that it causes the orbits to degrade over time, as the stars slowly spiral toward each other. This is a very consistent effect.Here's a graph showing the prediction of the existence of gravitational waves relative to the observations of the change of period of the Hulse-Taylor binary: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PSR_B1913%2B16_period_shif... The tiny horizontal lines on the red dots are the error bars of the observations. You can see how perfectly the observations line up with theory.Also, it's likely that gravitational waves will be observed directly within the next several years. There have been experiments attempting to do so but none of them have been sensitive enough to detect the most likely of the strongest signals of gravitational radiation.

The poster asked many questions, and in for a penny, in for a point, I offered some ideas, not really meant as a disagreement for the sake of disagreement.What you see reveals more a lack in my understanding. No, I have no idea how a co-op system would happen. I also have no idea how it happened in the places where it did happen. Researching now, I found http://www.academia.edu/3393216/Gentrification_-_gentle_or_t... which talks about city efforts to promote a co-op housing system. While it worked, it also encouraged the city's efforts to bring in an ""economically sustainable population"", which excludes the politically and economically less powerful who were able to afford the area before. BTW, there doesn't appear to be a grand architect for this system.Perhaps you're right, and Haussmann's authoritarian style, or great destruction, are the only ways to get major changes to a city's infrastructure. Certainly though there is much I don't like about the efforts of the American Haussmann, Robert Moses. But many cities have transformed over time, and not all used this imperious style.Urban evolution is a topic I know little about, but also one where there are many strong feelings and few certainties. I know some of my own feelings: 1) commuting is a waste of human time, 2) the price of petroleum does not reflect its true cost, 3) company subsidies for things like commuting, meals, laundry services, etc. should be counted as personal income, rather than a business expense (at time I think that personal frequent flier miles for business travel should be the same), 4) car travel is dangerous and should not be promoted over other means, and 5) I prefer the ""cuddly"" Nordic model of capitalism over the ""cut-throat"" free market capitalism (and think that the Nordic countries have been moving too much in recent years towards equating everything in market terms).With those in mind, what's ""wrong"" is a confluence of several factors. The transportation subsidizes should be included as part of the overall employee salary (SF's payroll tax on companies helps unbalance this a bit more), the Bay Area has no well integrated large scale mass transit system (thus Google et al. have a disproportionate influence on precisely which regions will be impacted by their specific choice of transportation routes), and 3) housing is too closely coupled to free market rates, so short term economic booms may break up community and emotional ties that take decades to establish (replacing it certainly with a different set of community and emotional ties, but see ""cuddly"")."

What about when the undercover let's a kid keep the change, is he then a drug dealer, since he made a profit. Well technically they're all drug dealers [sic], but where do you draw the line?The kid in this article was arrested because he sold drugs to an undercover cop. Well, technically he took $20, bought a small amount of weed, then gave it to the undercover. Technically it's drug dealing. Most people seemed outraged by this, rightfully so, as it seemed the cop pressured him to get him drugs (kind of seems like entrapment?). Is this kid wasn't autistic would people be so outraged? What about if it was 1oz of weed that he was the middle man to? The problem with things like this is that there is a law that defines the lines that you may, or may not cross. So until laws are reformed that makes it not criminal to sell drugs, we won't get problems like this. But a massive reform like that would have many repercussions. So why not just make it not criminal to sell under $20 worth of weed. But does that make a difference? Since it's still being sold but on a smaller scale.So, what I'm trying to say is, all the laws surrounding prohibition of drugs are stupid and when you have thousands of people involved in regulating the laws, it doesn't work out. The police officers in this case are only interested in the arrest numbers, so they can get more funding, so who's fault is that? Kids getting expelled for 'drug dealing', who's fault is that? The definition of 'drug dealer'? Who's fault is that? Illegal drugs? Who's fault is that? Should drugs be legal?"

But I also got a lot of negative reinforcement and had come to think of myself (as a certain book title suggests) as ""lazy, stupid, or crazy"" (ok - maybe just lazy or crazy) when it came to focus and procrastination issues. I never even considered ADD/ADHD because as far as I knew, it was a label for hyperactive kids and I was never hyperactive.Those are very broad terms, you know? I really felt like there was fundamental shit wrong with me. I grew up believing in hard work but had the hardest time doing homework and taxes and things I didn't want to do.So learning about and eventually being diagnosed with ADHD really helped the way I feel about myself. Instead of feeling broken on some fundamental level, I came to feel like I had a pretty specific thing to deal with; one that could be helped by medication and proper sleep/diet/environment/exercise.Edit: I also want to address this one specific thing you said:  Or do you have a personality type which might make you unsuited \n  for certain types of work?\n\nI can't think of a single line of work that doesn't benefit from an increased ability to focus.Even entrepreneurs, who are often famously ADHD (or ADHD-like, anyway) in their restlessness and curiosity, need to focus on the mundane stuff sometimes.And it's not like medication erases those positive ADHD traits either. The fact is that stimulants leave your body pretty quickly, and with something like your Adderall dosage from day to day. If you're responsible and take a little bit less on the days you don't need it, you can take a little more on the days when you need it more. You can tailor the effects a bit depending on your needs on a particular day.(Note: The medication is far from perfect; it's not for everybody and is not a cure-all.

Paying someone to kill off the rest of the 220 passengers would be a big challenge as well. And everybody involved would know that and the additional risk and thus demand much more money. You would have to find such an airbase. And you would have people at the airbase to take care of everything, including hiding the jet from satellites. And the airbase would have to be unused and remote.If you wanted to use one of the actual Malaysian Airlines pilots to divert the plane, I expect you might have great difficulty being confident about approaching the right guy (if any) without first being turned down and reported. Likely nothing else in the above is unduly difficult for a number of state actors. The rest of the passengers might not be killed either.> Ditching the aircraft safely into calm waters is even more unrealistic. First of all AFAIK it has never been successfully done with a wide-body aircraft and even in a small-body aircraft it would be a major risk. It would require perfect weather and calm ocean. And it would have happened at night!Perhaps, though if the plane went south to the Indian Ocean SATCOM arc it would apparently have been daylight when it was last pinged. (Source: http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/re... ) The primary radar reports seem to suggest otherwise though.> There are a ton of risks involved in all of this. How could they hijackers have known that the Malaysian air force wasn't properly looking at its radar? They could have scrambled jets at that point and all of this complicated plan would have been for nothing. What if the flight they allegedly used for the radar shadow would have been delayed or they would have been delayed? What if there had been a military ship with their own radar on an exercise or patrol? After all they flew over one of the busiest water lanes in the world with an active piracy problem. What if ...Flight 370 in all probability was pinged several times by primary radar without any decisive response. Someone whose job was to be well-informed about these things a) might well choose to take the calculated risk that Malaysia would do nothing effective and b) would likely have been right.> You are looking at it after the fact and not from the perspective of someone who had to come up with the plan and evaluate all the risks.> I'm not saying that kidnapping or killing a handful of people on the ground would be easy. But compared to such an unprecedented and skilled aircraft hijacking plan it seems like a piece of cake.On the contrary, I think that any such alternative plan to kidnap and interrogate a handful of the Freescale guys would probably seem at least as risky if you described it in some detail, then looked at it with as much scepticism as you've directed at the flight-370 version.I think the real primary reason to discount it at the moment is indeed the attention: the political blowback for being caught would be too painful, even if you'd had the minimal good sense not to deliberately kill the Chinese or US citizens on board. It would be a huge causus belli, more or less a second 9/11. Any attempt to misdirect the blame would likely not hold up long. (And a few secondary ones: China is the #1 usual suspect for military-industrial espionage on the US at present, and there are several additional reasons it wouldn't want to, or have to, pull something like this. A state hijacker would presumably be well informed enough not to be caught out by the disabling-ACARS-doesn't-shut-down-SATCOM gotcha.

Some desperate passengers might even deliberately start a fire in the fuselage, I suppose, as dangerous as that would be.One big problem with 4 is that to believe this you probably have to discount the primary radar reports of the airplane heading west over Malaysia/Thailand and then north up the Malacca Strait and Andaman Sea. It's hard to imagine the plane getting feet-dry on that northern SATCOM arc, at about the end of its fuel endurance, and then then heading far out to sea again. (Unless it landed and refuelled somewhere...)(EDIT: On second thoughts, I suppose you could turn east after the last radar contact and then go south, past the west of Indonesia, to the southern arc.)But even if you do that, where would you be headed if you were on that southern Indian Ocean arc after 7 hours in flight?

I can't think of a way to kidnap a handful of Freescale engineers all at once from urban China or urban Malaysia that could be described as much much easier.That said, I think it's highly improbable that the Freescale guys were targeted like this, but mainly because the political consequences of being caught doing something like this would probably be much too painful for most of the states who might really benefit from debriefing those engineers at length."

The evidence suggests that when it first ""disappeared"", and likely for hours afterwards, the plane was under controlled flight by someone with at least some idea of what they were doing. Whoever was flying the plane could easily deliberately crash it at any time while flying over the ocean, of course, but if their intention was just to crash the plane somewhere non-specific, why not just do it right away or soon afterwards? So they very probably had other intentions.And an airplane in a controlled cruise over the ocean is unlikely to just happen to crash into it by accident. It will obviously run out of fuel at some point, but the people flying the plane almost certainly planned to do something interesting with it before that happened: the likely candidates are a) land it or b) crash it into something notable. They probably had the ability to read the fuel gauge and/or an a priori idea of what the available range was, too. Now there are all sorts of ways their plan could have gone wrong, or could have succeeded by crashing the plane, but they nearly all involve the plane landing and/or crashing on land, or relatively near a coastline on the approach to land instead of the deep ocean. AFAICS it's easier to list ways in which the plane could be lost in the deep ocean:1) A Flight 93-style battle for the cockpit erupts while 370 is over the ocean2) The person flying the plane is a terrorist/hijacker/pirate who lacks real airliner flying expertise but has been equipped with a cheat sheet telling him in detail exactly what to do. Everything goes fairly well for a long time until something unexpected happens and/or he messes up one of his scheduled actions. At this point he likely panics and maybe does something rash3) The people in control attempt a controlled ditch somewhere in the ocean, probably in order to rendezvous with one or more speedboats and transfer themselves and some or all passengers. This could very easily go wrong, but succeed or fail the plane will probably end up sinking either way4) The people in control attempt to strike out across the ocean for some distant target which they guess is near the limit of their range. But they miscalculate, and by the time they realise it they're trapped over the ocean with no path back near land in timeScenarios 3 and 4 are fairly unlikely if you believe the radar interpretations suggesting that the plane went west across Malaysia and then north, though."

However, I see three main bad reasons for the recent explosive growth in the FIRE sector:1. Their cost of borrowing is artificially low. They don't need depositors anymore. They can borrow limitless funds from the Federal Reserve now at 0.25%. Their real borrowing rate is actually negative if we're honest about inflation, rather than relying on fabricated government numbers that leave out housing, healthcare, food, fuel and education.2. The Fed is creating artificial demand for financial products. After the 2008-9 crisis, the Fed has created $3T out of thin air and used half of it to buy mortgage backed securities.3. Over the last 30 years, the federal government has shown its willingness to bailout failed financial institutions that took on too much risk-- We saw it with the S crisis of the 1980s and 1990s; we saw it with the 1998 bailout of LTCM; and we saw it again with the $700B TARP in 2008.If we would simply allow the free market (rather than The Fed and federal government) to determine interest rates, and the demand for securities, and the appropriate level of risk appetite, then we'd see the FIRE sector shrink back to its historically low share of GDP.

This devaluation of currency is especially evident when you consider that Ben Bernake printed up $3T out of thin air, and used half of it to buy up worthless mortgage backed securities.But there's an even bigger issue at stake: While the US pays a lot of lip service to capitalism, this is not the way capitalism is supposed to work.

I'm not one to hate on any environment or ecosystem. I do make fun of PHP or Java at times, but it's all good-natured. Not to be too PC, but yes, every thing has its pros and cons.Personally, however, I think C# as a language strikes the right balance in terms of power, ease-of-use, learnability and code readability. Even if you have a problem with Microsoft, I think it is wrong to let your ""MS-hate"" translate into ""C#-hate"". It is a beautiful language and the open-source community around it is growing rapidly. The progress made by platform-independent endeavors (case in point Xamarin) is admirable.In the unlikely scenario that all of programming were to converge into one language, I would want it to be an open-source, platform-independent version of C# (with maybe just a tad more constructs borrowed from the functional programming world).P.S.

Rails shines most when you do things as intended.Even though I wouldn't have designed rails the way it is (remote forms and .js.erb views anyone?), it works really well for a large class of applications.Of course you may eventually hit a wall, but that happens when software outgrows it's original requirements. That doesn't mean you have to build a system for millions of concurrent users from day one. Especially not, when you're making accounting software or a crm or some other run-off-the-mill webapp.In my experience, rails ""improvements"" are often suggested, when a developer is faced with a large mudball of a rails application that doesn't do things according to convention. This can quickly happen, because rails is deceptively easy to learn. Many developers I know (myself included), started writing a serious app in Rails, without learning a lot about it. Heck, if you're a rails developer and honest with yourself, you probably didn't even read all of the rails guides. In addition to that, I recommend reading a book such as ""The Rails Way"" front to cover, joining the mailing list, following the core team's blogs and potentially even going through the code. I also DON'T recommend taking your patterns from random blog posts or stack overflow. Rails is very well documented and you can generally find what you need in the docs.As infuriatingly dismissive as his tone sometimes is, I've actually found it best to follow dhh's advice. Not only because I generally agree with it, but also because it's likely to be the best supported design in future rails versions."

It's generally speaking a PITA. Where ever you go, you need to take your medication with you. Depending on what you get, you might have to take it on schedule. Depending on what you get, the pharmacy round the corner needs to order it and the stuff needs a prescription. Most stuff has side-effects, mine is mildly liver-toxic which means that I need to go have blood tests about every 8 weeks. I need to go to the doctor every 4 weeks for the prescription. When I travel longer than 4 weeks I need to jump through several hoops to get a larger amount. It's much better than without treatment, so if a friend asks me how I'm doing with the medication, I'd say ""extremely well"", but mainly because without medication it's extremely bad.Yes, medication helps and it's sometimes the last remedy when nothing else helps. But I think that not labeling all conditions that lead to ADHD-like symptoms as ADHD and rather try and find a more nuanced understanding of the problem is helpful, especially in a case where a condition is often diagnosed on children where parents read stuff on the internet and run from doctor to doctor to doctor trying to get a prescription for ritalin, since they're certain that the kid matches those 5 relatively generic symptoms."

Treat them as individual conditions with different causes and administer appropriate treatment - don't just hand them pills because it's simple.I sincerely doubt that stimulants are the best treatment we can give those people. They may help in the short term, but they're highly addictive and your body develops a tolerance. What are you going to do once those people are tolerant to medication? Wave your hand in the air, tell them ""bad luck, you developed a tolerance, now have a nice day"". Medication may be required in some cases, but it's often only the beginning of a treatment. You need to solve or at least tackle the complex problem to really help them - and assigning a simple label doesn't always help."

Most teams I know of prefer to write their code using the native toolkits. For them, writing in C# would be an extra cost. Few see writing equivalent code in Objective-C and Java as prohibitive because it's very common to host the bulk of the functionality on servers and only run UI code on the mobile client. UI code has traditionally been non-portable.For those who are already writing their mobile apps in C# for whatever reason, porting to Windows Phone is already easier than porting from Objective-C or Java."

It has been widely reported that iOS 6 was slower (as well as breaking things like Google Maps), iOS 7 was slower still (as well as making various visual styling changes we don't like) and both iOS 6 and iOS 7 have suffered at least one severe security flaw that iOS 5 did not have. In short, there appears to be no rational reason we would ""upgrade"" this device as we are repeatedly prompted to do.Recently, Apple appears to have changed the rules for app developers so new things going into the app store have to aim primarily at iOS 7. At some point we upgraded an app we'd bought a while ago to get some much-plugged new feature that someone thought was interesting. Aside from the fact that the new feature itself turned out to be paywalled anyway, so the upgrade invitation for the app was basically just spam abusing the app store mechanism, the ""upgraded"" app also had a horribly glitchy UI where previously it had been smooth as silk drawing exactly the same screens.Can we ""downgrade"" that app back to something that works, which we already had before, via the app store or otherwise? No, it doesn't seem so.If we ""upgraded"" iOS itself, as suggested to fix the app (though we've seen no reports that doing so does in fact fix this app), could we then ""downgrade"" again if we didn't like it? Also no, as far as we can tell.As it happens, we need to have Apple devices around for testing our web stuff, so we're stuck with spending some of our company money on new gear now and then for as long as our customers are doing the same, and we're stuck with using more recent versions of iOS on some devices for the same reason. But at this point, nothing would ever convince me to spend my own money on an iSomething. I was always suspicious of the lock-in and kindergarten UI, and seeing it in action, the results are at least as bad as I expected.What is possibly more interesting is that it seems average users are getting fed up as well. Not so long ago, mobile visits to a site I run that isn't particularly geek-related were utterly dominated by iOS devices. Today, while iOS still represents a clear majority, it is a much closer balance between iOS and Android, and the trend is strongly in the latter's direction. I can't help wondering whether this is people who've now been not-upgraded to more recent versions one time too many, or who've been forced to dump expensive and otherwise working hardware for artificial software reasons, starting to vote with their wallets."

Yes, there is police harassment like anywhere, but it's not codified into law and openly defended by politicians. As for 'unusual' punishments, excessive sentencing is a 'cruel or unusual' punishment.My point was that the US is not the bastion of freedom that it's PR suggests. I was pointing out the US Bill of Rights still doesn't prevent these abuses from happening, as people seem to mythologise that document. I've mentioned in other threads that the level of freedom between the two countries really isn't that dissimilar - it's just that the idea that the US is the paragon of freedom above and beyond its contemporaries just simply is not true.Anyway, I mentioned two things about Australia that you are apparently debunking: that we don't edit the constitution in the normal process of politics, because it requires a referendum to do so; and that we don't fear our neighbours like people in East Germany did. I said ""Australia is not a bleak wasteland"" and you say I'm glossing over reality? I wonder if you've ever been here, or if you merely think The Road Warrior is a documentary?

Australians are not as accepting of robocalls as Americans are (and with mobile phones becoming the norm, robocalls get expensive); the voting date is hard to fake since everyone has to vote at the same time and there are media blitzes about the date itself; and polling addresses are meaningless, because if you don't go to one of the ones for your electorate, you can go into a polling station anywhere in the country and record a vote, it just takes marginally longer. If you try and make it so that voters have to queue for 8 hours to lodge a vote in order to marginalise them, people will give up and go to another polling station. People here complain bitterly if they have to wait an hour to vote.If someone did try the voting date switcheroo and succeeded in stopping a sizeable portion of people from voting, the most likely outcome - apart from the scandal - would be that the Australian Electoral Commission would call for a repeat of the voting for that electorate.

Using this kind of hyperbole does no-one any favours. Do you really think that Australians fear their neighbours like the people in East Germany did? The PM recently said that the government broadcasting agent should not be so negative about the government and should be more like it's cheer squad. He was pilloried by the private press for saying such a thing.I'm interested to know what privacy and personal rights you think the US has that Australia doesn't. The US has 'bear arms', true. It has slightly greater private freedom of speech, but in practice slightly worse freedom of speech for the press.As for the content of the constitution, that's not the way we do law. Just because the US shoves every silly thing into their constitution (or at least tries to), it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist for us if it's not in our constitution. We have shitloads of law outside the constitution. Hardly surprising, since in the US, you only require politicians to amend the constitution, but in Australia, you need to hold a referendum. And even in the US, the vast bulk of nattering about the constitution is just grandstanding - a law is a law. Being in the constitution simply makes it harder to repeal. Not being in the constitution doesn't make it any less legally binding, just easier to strike down."

But the three exceptions can be fairly major:1. Price (well, duh). Netflix is cheap imo, Spotify is cheap, but piracy is still free.2. Spread of content. Less an issue with Spotify which has just about EVERYTHING but more so with video services. Piracy has any movie, any TV show. Netflix (and other services) only have those they've signed up.3. Availability. Netflix is great in the US, okay in the UK, tolerable in other places. HBO Go is only available in a few countries. BBC iPlayer only in the UK. It's patchy.But: the signs are there than when content owners and distributions services can get their act together, legitimate distribution is a better user experience than piracy. That's only been the case for the last year, eighteen months. Mulligan appears to be casting aside many years of history when piracy was the only game in town. Popcorn Time has a great UI and is simple to use, but it's now playing catch-up with paid services when for a decade or more, piracy was streets ahead in ability and usability."

They radio a goodbye as they leave ATC, still unaware of anything which means that a fire has taken out a transponder and they are unaware of that fact\n3. The fire is discovered. The crew put on full-face oxygen masks and the pilot makes for that airport either by dialling in a bearing into the autopilot or disengaging it and flying for it.\n4. They attempt communication but fail because the systems are out due to the fireAt that point, we then have a lot of things to consider: was it pilot input or autopilot that took them to FL450? When did the pilots lose the ability to land, either because of control surface damage or because they were incapacitated? In the event of being alive but unable to fly the aircraft because control surfaces were no longer responsive to cockpit or autopilot input, is there anything else they could/would do other than do some maths and work out when the inevitable crash was coming? If they could control some surfaces but not others would they use that to buy themselves more time, e.g. climbing to ceiling (FL450), or would they get low quick?This theory raises quite a few questions then, but it's a perfectly valid hypothesis: the issue for me around it is understanding why the pilots didn't go on to make the landing suggesting loss of control or their own lives by that point. The only way we'll get to understand that is by finding the black box which of course would explain the whole thing anyway.This theory also suggests a likely ditching or crash into the water, and if that were the case then I would expect sonar operators over a large part of the region to hear the black box locator, pretty much as they did with the Air France crash."

It is usually not a simple process that ""just works"" (on Windows in particular).\n> I know a guy who managed to write a game in Ruby and somehow turned the code into standalone Windows binaries. I know that Rust can be used on Windows, that you can use it to build standalone binaries, that is not the point. The point is how well, idiomatically, and smoothly that works.I've done it many times, and it is not quite bad to do that (it can even give a single executable file at some initial slowdown). In fact, it is so impressive that the non-compiled implementation can make a working and portable executable file at all. Rust is primarily a (ahead-of-time) compiled language and it would take a single command `rustc foo.rs` (or possibly `rustc -L foo.rs`?) to produce an executable file `foo.exe`. [1][1] Assuming you haven't used 0.9 and later versions, it now produces a statically linked binary by default. No `libblahblabla.dll` around.> If you do not consider consoles or embedded systems major platforms that is. Most of the world is not POSIX.It really depends on the definition (and I'm not saying POSIX is not the most widely available platform), but mobiles alone (approx. 300 million units sold) give a significant portion of POSIX systems.> The last time I tried to use Rust on Windows it required a particular version of MinGW.You haven't used 0.9, right? That restriction was temporary and it has now lifted. I think you still need MinGW for linkers right now though.> I have used C and C++ for a long time, and I cannot say that dependency hell was ever a problem. One of the many things wrong with the ""package manager"" paradigm is that it encourages people to write software which is a tangled web of dependencies. Software should have few third-party dependencies, that makes maintenance and porting a lot easier. Witness the recent Python 2 -> 3 drama. The primary reason why people did not, could not upgrade to Python 3 was because they had to wait for all the dependencies of their apps to be ported. Many are still waiting.Python 3 is a bad choice in my opinion as it hasn't learned from the precedent of Perl 6 ""failure"" (this was finally resolved when Perl 5 development has been restarted). But that does not justify the C/C++'s lack of package system: there are lots of old and faulty C/C++ codes around due to the lack of recent C99 or C11 or C++11 compilers at the disposal even without the package system."
4790,2824,3.1780538303479458,24.0,"> Every language which needs a ""package manager"" tends to make building standalone applications painful.Huh? Python has a (sort of) package manager and you can still make a standalone application by bundling every dependency. You are very certainly mistaking the OS-level package manager (used primarily for installing applications) from the language-level package manager (used primarily for building applications). Once you have built a standalone binary, the job of the language-level package manager is done.> However, C++ is a platform agnostic language, while Rust thus far has only supported Linux as a first class platform. I find the attitude of the Rust devs (""we will improve Windows support once the language is stable"") deeply misguided. It meant that they largely missed out on feedback from Windows developers during the development of the language. ""Windows developers"" also means all the AAA PC(+console) game developers (the most diehard C++ users). Linux still is not a relevant platform there.I regularly use Rust (nightly) in Windows. Windows support is problematic since it differs from every other major platform, but it did not have a serious problem that seriously discourages the Windows platform. (Not to mention that I regularly build a standalone binary for Windows!) I admit it is not in the best state, but it should be improved and is being improved.> And the Rust developers seem to continue to go down that rabbit hole by enlisting Ruby developers to develop a ""package manager"". As a Windows guy the very word makes me cringe. How is that thing going to integrate with Visual Studio and other Windows specific concerns? Ruby only really works on Linux, first advice you get as a Windows guy wanting to learn Ruby is ""Install Linux, if you try to do Ruby development on Windows you are in for a world of pain"". I do not trust any Ruby developer to write portable software, they are married to the GNU/Linux ecosystem. Would you expect Microsoft guys to develop something which actually works well on Linux?As a multiplatform guy the introduction of package manager actually marks the divorce with the strong Unix assumption, since Rust has actively avoided the platform-dependent tools so much that it now does not require the C compiler at all (!) and the only remaining platform-dependent tool was the Make. This is now about to change.> Also remember that C++ does not have a ""package manager"". Some of the most complex and massive applications in the world are written in C++, yet you do not hear many C++ developers crying ""When will we finally get a package manager?"". It is not even on the agenda. C does not have one either.That's why SQLite ships with an amalgamated source code, a sort of unfortunate thing. Dependency problem is so bad in C/C++ that most developers gave up and grew the half-baked solutions, which have another share of problems."

No single Scheme is widely adopted and the main reason for that is extreme balkanization. You dont write code in Scheme, you write Guile, Racket, Chicken, etc.The Scheme philosophy, which was developed in opposition to batteries-included aka ""bloated"" Common Lisp, was to have a small core and emphasize simplicity, purity, etc. For years proponents of Scheme have emphasized how beautiful and simple the small standard of 50 pages is, compared with Common Lisps ""bloated"" 1000+ pages standard.This had two consequences:1. It was extremely easy to write a scheme implementation, soinstead of writing code _in_ scheme, people wrote _schemes_. Hundreds of them. And while other people spent the last 20 years writing thousands of useful libraries in C, python, java, scheme implementors spent reinventing the wheel, over and over and over and over again. Today there are more implementations of scheme than libraries in scheme.2. The emphasis on ""small core"" might be cute for teaching SICP, but in order to be able to do anything useful with the implementation, it forced the implementors to reinvent the wheels for everything else. And each implementation did it their own way because standardization was considered ""selling out"" and aping the nemesis Common Lisp. This led to _extreme_ code unportability.Nowadays they are somehow trying to standardize, but with the consequence that they are realizing that by doing that, they are becoming indistinguishable from their old nemesis Common Lisp, which went through the same balkanization phase 20 years ago, so the point of splitting off Scheme from Lisp is becoming questionable. Instead of wasting precious time writing 1001 scheme implementations, they could have spent the last 20 years writing useful common lisp libraries and competing with other batteries-included languages like java and python.In short: Besides the social problems that every Scheme suffers from and the Lisp world suffered during the 80s, Guile on its own is doing quite well. Once it is integrated into Emacs, Emacs will become Guile's killer app, boost its popularity and set it apart from other schemes."

With the code of conduct, it becomes more clear; blatantly sexual language is over the line, and it can be dealt with by expulsion from the conference. It's simple, and it lets you not worry about it; as a conference organizer, you don't have to worry about how prominent in the community someone is when they make a porn-based presentation, you can just firmly say ""no."""
4814,2913,2.302585092994046,10.0,"> Inviting somebody for beers isn't hitting on themThat's not true. It can be hitting on them, or it can not be. If you think you might be in a grey area, maybe err on the side of making it feel safer by making it a group outing rather than putting them on the spot. Don't use that doubt about the grey area as an excuse for avoiding talking to women at all, however.> Except, again, there are lots of vocal people screaming how this is not okay.I have never heard someone scream such a thing. Jesus, if I complimented someone and they screamed at me, I'd think they were crazy. Do people really scream about that at you?Remember, don't confuse vocal debate on Twitter or HN with screaming. It's really not the same. People are frequently more blunt online than they are in real life. This happens in all directions. But don't act like it's the end of the world when a few people are overly vocal on the internet.Also, don't respond to legitimate, reasonable complaints, like ""I'm the technical person coming to this conference and people ignore me and talk to my fiance instead"" with ""well yeah, but this other thing over here blew up way out of proportion on the internet, so I can't treat you like a normal person in real life.""Yes, there is occasional overreaction that has real life consequences, like the unfortunate PyCon ""dongle"" incident. That's really the exception rather than the rule, however, and the real-life consequences happened in both directions. Note that many, many prominent feminist writers came out against both Adria Richard's actions and those of the the company that fired the guy making the joke."

If you feel like you have to worry about this all the time, there's something seriously off about your interpersonal instincts. I'm a pretty socially awkward nerdy guy, and I've never had a problem with being able to have a technical conversation with a woman without being accused of ""mansplaining"", ""being overly aggressive"", being ""screamed about on twitter"" or the like. If all of those things are happening to you, you're probably going about it wrong.Remember, you hear about the worst incidents online. The things that make it to the news do so because they're newsworthy, not because they're commonplace.Since many of us are socially awkward nerds here, let me give you a few hints:Inviting someone for beers after a conference is not hitting on them. But if you're really worried it appearing that way, make sure you invite more than one person; it feels much more like an after-conference beer than an invitation to a date if there's a group of people.Complementing someone on what they're wearing? I complement my male coworkers on their new sneakers or spiffy new jackets sometimes; it's no more creepy to do the same for a female coworker. But I wouldn't do that to some guy I just met, only someone I've known for a while and already have a professional relationship with. If the first thing I said to a guy was a complement on his shoes, that would sound a little weird, wouldn't it, like I might be hitting on him? Same rule goes. Don't make a complement on a woman's clothes or appearance be the first thing you say to her, that makes it sound like you're hitting on her. But if you've known her a while and you notice that she's gotten a new haircut or new jacket, it's not a problem to mention it.Asking about someone's projects? How would you imagine that would sound like flirting? Just make sure you're actually interested in someone's projects, and not just using it as a ""get to know you"" before trying to ask them on a date."

The pilots in that case recovered and returned to the airport for an emergency landing.  However, I wonder how different it would be over the ocean and at night.> The point is, the transponder just happened to turn off at the perfect moment (between two ATC services) after the ACARS had been switched off long before.Yeah.  Recovery over the water at night is one thing.  Flying for hours after is a very, very different scenario, and that's what makes the difference for me."

This is why I assumed it was an accident (like Air France 447) at first.> Give it some time, let the investigators work and report their findings. I'd be very surprised if it's not a combination of system failure and human error in reacting to the failure.That was my first impulse too.  Google ""IEEE Automation Paradox Air France 447.""  However, this is really hard to square with the engine information.  So you have three possibilities:  the plane flew an uncommanded course on autopilot for 5 hours following an accident, the flight data is wrong, or it is a hijacking.In this case an investigation is hard because there is so little information.  It took until the black boxes were recovered from AF447 to determine what happened there.  Here?  We don't even know where the plane is, much less the relevant recorders."

Electrical fires are more common than hijackings, especially after you figure in airport security.  Therefore in plane design you worry about electrical fires far more than you do hijackings.Additionally this is the first incident of its kind.  This is not a typical hijacking.  In fact it is entirely unprecedented.  For this reason it is a game changer, and I think you are right to point that out.  But electrical fires are orders of magnitude more common so you aren't going to ever risk one based on a much less likely possibility here.To be honest, I have faith that investigators will eventually track the culprits down.  Then once we know who and why we can decide what to do about it.  However consider what is required to pull this off:1.  Having an airport capable of landing a 777 that nobody knows about2.  Having refuling equipment and fuel.3.  Having a hangar capable of storing the 777 out of the eyes of satellites.These are not small requirements.  Whoever did this was quite prepared.  It was not pilot suicide based on the data we have.  Whoever did this was large, organized, and had tons of resources (we are talking about a large drug ring or a small country here).

Most analysts don't have prior industry experience in their field before becoming an analyst. Although they (usually) pick up enough as they go along to understand the terms and major issues, they have little depth and are unable to reason from first principles. I work for one of these large analyst firms and my estimate is that less than 10% of our analysts have relevant industry experience. We are not unexeptional in this.2. Vendors invest heavily in analyst relations. While this helps to better inform the analysts, it also pushes the vendor's world view. Invites to conferences and events, access to senior execs, early access to information, etc. also help reinforce the bond between the vendor and the analyst.

But then I get on the Ubuntu laptop and hack on my github repo. I'm not a jock and I'm not a hipster, I'm a sensitive hacker.I want to start a company not for the money because once it gets big, not only will give me financial freedom but will give me an opportunity to give back to the open-source community (after all, isn't what social networking is originally about, finding an connection). I'll start a blog with a side-bar with me as the Founder of X. I'll give the traditional old media/education/gov't and even tech establishment a piece of my mind, information is suppose to be free, college is dead, employee's are companies not employees, bitcoins is the future and the establishment is just afraid of change. I'll work hard, I'll code and code some more until I ship, in between the late night hackathon and late afternoon coding hangover, I'll tweet for a break, I'll share on your FB wall, I'll reddit and share my thoughts with the community (after all, that's what coding is about, finding a connection),I occasionally come across article about burn-outs. Of course, I've had that for sure, no correction, I've had many mental breakdowns. It makes me pause, think and re-evaluate. But I've grown wiser and stronger, I'm not that same person. I know what's important in my life. My friendships and my SO. I'm going to book a ticket on Stubhub for a show next weekend that I and my GF can go to, starred artist on her Spotify. And just booked another trip to Austin to visit my college friend, just in time for SXSW. (After all, that's what life is about, finding a connection). I and my SO taking salsa lessons and I bike on weekends to find another positive outlet to vent my frustration and energy (after all, that's what life is about, trying out new things and discovering yourself). I'm saving money consciously for a down payment for a house after reading more about passive income because I'm growing to become an adult.I'm an responsible adult now, a sensitive hacker who hacks; And I'll code and code some more and then I'll spend some quality time with my SO.And I will ship, that's for sure. Ship or die trying."

The recording industry is the man-in-the-middle between listeners and artists. Auto-dealerships are the man-in-the-middle between car companies and car buyers.

I was just stating from the side of that not all that might be deemed sexism was always meant as such.  i.e. usually it is stupidity over arrogance which some assume the latter and more often it is the former. Almost all misunderstandings stem from some aspect of this. Where people are stupid, they need to learn somehow, examples help.But living in a world with 99% of people not being technical (unless you are at work) you have to assume most people are not and talk to them in that way, nothing to do with gender really. In that aspect talking in a way that a person understands is polite (completely ignoring is another thing entirely -- a good speaker involves all).  Once that person lets it be known that they are technical then a new door opens up and you can drop some acronyms.  Any person will tune their message to their assumed crowd otherwise they waste alot of air. If you go up to 100 people (or women) and just start talking in programmer/technical jargon most of them will look at you funny. I talk to dudes I work with differently that are in business and programming as well. I don't talk down to them in any way, I communicate. If they get it, all engines ahead, if not, they ask for a simplified version, same deal with aspects of the business on the flipside.What I see is also a problem in the sexism journey is that sometimes people that are understanding and do see the problem get pulled into it in ways that make them look bad. I almost didn't post the message above because I knew I'd get some of this even though I 100% agree.  So they stay away from it, just because there may be gender issues doesn't mean there isn't some give and pull on both sides to help it along."

I bet if you dropped some technical info early it would knock it out of that mode quickly.  I know when a women knows or doesn't know about tech I do change how I talk but I do this with anyone that is technical/non-technical.  The old Feynman tune it to your crowd when you educate/market type of steward.Also since there are so few women in tech, men don't usually work with them during the day and aren't the most alpha, lots of them could be shy or even have difficulty with eye contact at all. If they are introverted even moreso like many programmers are. Many are also young and not married which leads to awkwardness at times with ladies.I think there are lots of opportunities for really skilled women but these intricacies should be stated more often so people understand and correct their assumptions. People need examples like this to learn how subtle it can be because just hearing 'sexism' doesn't help educate, more women with more examples as it is eye opening and helps understanding of this problem."

I am talking about rehabilitation for a crime committed against others who worked hard for their money. There is a difference.If you run a ponzi scheme, you are incurring large debtors prison type effects on others (taking their rights they earned -- they lose their hard earned money and have to work harder to get it back).  The punishment should be the same for ponzi fraudsters at that level. They need to work throughout their sentence at a job to feel what they have done to others.  They would also maybe get more insight out of it and rehabilitate more in life feeling the effects of what they have done.  I am talking about cases for high profile fraud, again not debt prison for non-criminals but more like a fine that fits the crime just as we do today with that not costing us room and board.What would be better for a guy like Bernie Madoff? Sitting in an everything provided cushy prison after stealing everyone's money or having to work back that debt through a job in society? He'd get alot more rehabilitation seeing how hard it is for the duration of his sentence. It will never happen but it is more closely rehabilitation than sitting in a prison costing tax payers even more. It would also keep him away from other high profile criminals.

For instance take someone who does some financial crime, why lock them up and have the public on the hook for 30k per year or more when they could be making money back they stole and mark them for some period of time similar to jail time. Why cost the public 30k+ per inmate at all if it isn't a violent crime? What a waste."

These two paragraphs are a perfect counterpoint to the uninformed claims I hear about ADHD all the time, so I'll probably mention them the next time I hear people claim that ADHD 'doesn't exist'.I think the only real problem is that ADHD has always been improperly named[0]. The actual condition itself has very little to do with attention.  The condition is named not after the cause, but after a symptom - and worse, after a symptom that is not even characteristic of the condition. Not all people with ADHD actually exhibit attention issues as their primary symptom, or even at all.It's like referring to depression as ""Excessive sleep disorder"". Well, sure, excessive sleep is oftentimes a symptom of depression. But taking stimulants won't (necessarily) help, and trying to force people to ""just wake up"" (or, more commonly, ""just be happy!"") isn't a solution.It's no longer socially acceptable to tell dyslexic people that their condition doesn't exist and that they are ""dumb"".

Don't have the real-time bits depend in any way with the code running on the CPU.  Have it buffer the data.  The, when the PCI card is accessed by the userland program on the CPU, it dumps the buffer onto the PCI bus.  The userland would obviously have be fast enough that the buffer doesn't fill up, but that speed is much less than ""real time"".

5922,3500,0.0,1.0,"Though I don't have any stats ready on how many heroin users end up as addicts that actually hurt their health, and how many recover later, you don't seem to have it either. Before we have some kind of numbers, I don't think discussing this can lead anywhere constructive.I'm pretty sure that most users of nicotine (as smoked tobacco or in electronic cigarettes) get physiologically addicted pretty quickly, and in a pretty hard way. Though this is inconvenient to them, it usually does not bother people around, because nicotine is not a behavior-altering substance (unlike alcohol or cocaine). AFAIK, heroin is not a behavior-altering substance either. It's the lack of a dose what dangerously alters the behavior of a heroine addict (or an alcohol addict).Since heroin is outlawed, users have far lower thresholds to pass to act unlawfully in other regards, since they feel like criminals already. A heavy nicotine addict may suffer immensely without a fix, but usually stays a lawful citizen despite it.Take insulin: it's also intended to be used as a drug, and improper use can quickly kill you. Thats why it's a prescription-only substance, but a completely lawful one. Quite a few over-the-counter drugs can kill you, or at least severely cripple you, if used improperly. Do you think outlawing them is a good idea? (Hell, 3/4 pound of table salt, if ingested quickly, would kill you. I hope you exercise reason when adding salt to your food.)"

HDFS (with HDSF-RAID) is probably the closest.. but it's still a long way off.I'd be interested in what other assumptions you're using to come up with the $5/T profit margin. Are you considering the cost of ingress and egress bandwidth, cooling, personnel to enact repairs? With a large enough fleet you'll have many drives/machines die every day. What about a team of engineers in an on-call rotation to keep to respond when (inevitable) failures occur?

Of course, it is unknown if it is the exact Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin, or someone hijacked the account, or some member of the hypothetical pseudonymous Satoshi collective, but the email did match up with the one in the original Bitcoin paper.At this point, Satoshi being Dorian is pretty much debunked, really."
