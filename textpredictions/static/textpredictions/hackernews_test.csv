But its use of structural typing instead of nominative typing effectively means it takes half the compiler assistance you can get out of static type checking and chucks it out the window.  Using structural typing means that a type is nothing more than the sum of its parts; nominative typing makes it possible to add further specificity to types by naming them.  This is huge.

While the people on there, mostly developers of various clones, had plenty to say about the issues with NetHack, including its code, one thing they did agree on: NetHack is a game about exceptions. What makes it fun is exactly what makes the code is damn terrible; that is, every interaction between any two or more objects is a series of if/else if statements. For example, you can dip an object into another object if it's a potion, a fountain, a sink. If you dip it into a fountain, you may summon a jinni, or the fountain might dry up. If you dip a potion into another potion, you might make a new potion; or dilute the original; or bless or curse the original. Or you might create an explosion. This is a simple example with mostly straightforward rules. Things like interactions between thrown objects and their targets are more subtle but more complex. This is why I play NetHack: because the complexity makes it fun. A simpler game like 2048 can also be fun, but it's predictable. NetHack is different every time you play it."

530,1587,0.0,1.0,"It's all about how the points are connected to each other. In 1d obviously you can only have 2 connections per node - one to the left and one to the right. In 2d you have a lot more flexibility. You can curve lines around to make much more connected graphs.In 2d there are still restrictions though, mainly the ""3 utilities problem"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_utilities_problem But in 3d, you don't have restrictions on connections anymore. You can always weave a new connection around the existing ones.In a square, each corner is connected to 2 neighbors. In a cube, each corner has 3 connections. In a 4d hypercube, the corners have 4 connections. So to make a ""4d"" hypercube in 3d, just draw 4 connections between corners :) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg  Some supercomputers have nodes connected in a hyper-torus configuration. It doesn't matter how you arrange the nodes physically, they just run cables around to recreate the interconnections that would exist in a 4d torus.For 4d, it's easy enough to do the corners. Each one has 4 connections - one each for up/down dimension, left/right, forward/back, and... +W/-W direction. You can see this in the game. Each corner can move two directions in its own square, or to two other squares, total of 4 directions.  If you want to do more than just corners though, it gets more complex. Think of a 3d cube  http://joppi.github.io/2048-3D/?utm_source=hn A piece on the edge can move to two corners, or the center of two faces. Actually, it's easier to think of it as lots of little cubes, stuck together so you only have corners :) A 3x3x3 cube is really 8 2x2x2 cubes that share some nodes. So the block in the very center has lots of options. Up, down, left, right, forward, or backward - 6 options. That's twice as many as the corners! That's because the corners are as far as you can go in one direction, so they can only move back the other way. Pieces in the middle can move either way - exactly twice as many options.Let's make an even bigger hypercube, 3x3x3x3. That's 64 little 2x2x2x2 cubes stacked in 4d. That's 8 3x3x3 cubes that make up the ""faces"" of the hypercube, and each cube has 8 2x2x2 smaller cubes in it. But remember most of those nodes are shared by more than one cube/hypercube. So the corners of our hypercube can only move to 4 other spaces. A piece in an edge can move to either corner, or into one of the 3 faces. (Look again if you can't imagine all 3 faces https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hypercube.svg) So that's 5 options for a piece on the edge. The middle of a face can move (say) up and down and left and right, as well as into the middle of either cube that it's on. For a space on a face, that image is actually awful. Remember, that outer cube is a whole other cube, it's overlapping all the other cubes in that picture. Try this page http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/8-cell.html  Anyway, a piece in the middle of a face can move (say) up, down, left, right, or into the center of either of the two cubes that it's on - one in the forward direction, the other in the +W direction. Try visualizing this for several different faces until your intuition kicks in :)  Finally, the piece in the very center can move either direction in each dimension, for a total of 8 directions, exactly twice as many as the corners. It will always end up in the center of a face, because those are the only pieces it's connected to."

Sometimes, it doesn't. This is why those of us who have real neurological anxiety or mood disorders can never expect genuine accommodation. Our disease is the culling agent that, with enough stress, will also flare up in the normal and be attributed (God of the Gaps) to ""personal weakness"".We have this fucked-up culture of ""powering through"" that malaise.

But, in our culture of ""power through it and get the prize"", most people don't get the help they need until it's too late.I would argue, though, that there's no value in this war of attrition. We have enough resources to give everyone a good life and autonomy over their work, and it's only getting better. Why do we set up these health-destroying tournaments of fools in the first place? If we need to pick leaders, it will happen naturally. If we don't, then why not have a looser arrangement where everyone has some autonomy?This attrition game that we use to fill the corporate and academic upper ranks doesn't pick good leaders.

If I'm offline, it's usually a waste of time and most likely, I should be taking a walk.2) Having a dev environment that is remote means my computer can completely fail and in 5 min, I'm deploying production code again. It means I can move between machines without ANYTHING being different. Leave your work computer at work, work from a friend's computer, yours, it doesn't matter.3) You actually have control over your box resources. Cloud9 boxes were abysmally slow, even though their editor was better. Koding was way too focused on social and attempting to do too much. Nitrous is simple and fast.That being said, here is what Nitrous needs to work on:1) Uptime has been sub-par. They've had problems, especially with US-East, that have led to me not being able to work. This has been minimal, but enough to make me concerned.2) The editor is very minimal. There is no fuzzy searching for files (like in Sublime), no auto-complete, no code hinting, no error checking other than really basic stuff, like indentation in Python or broken div tags in HTML. Having dabbled with Cloud9's editor, which is fantastic, I def think they need to focus on this.3) Collaborative editing seems half-baked. Each user has to open the same file and then press a button ""Collab Mode"". If either forgets to press the button, your editing different files. There's also no sharing of console output, so this means if you are running a script that you are both working on, you both cannot see the same console output.

It's unpredictable, you don't know when you've got an end product, and it involves dealing with workers who have egos, who often work on things you don't understand.  It is unmanageable, which obviously troubles those whose job it is to manage.The most common approach, so far, has been to ignore this scary possibility:  Keep projects as low-level as possible, spread responsibility far and wide (to reduce risk, not for optimal efficiency), and keep everyone wearing business casual.Developers are (often) in the weird position of Ozzy Osbourne and other rock stars:  potheads whose potheadery became valuable.

Discrimination/racism protections especially suffer from this.I've had some experience with this as well. In Europe (Brussels) it's plain to see that most companies don't hire certain ""bad"" minorities, then fix their legally mandated ""racism stats"" (ie. a quota) by demanding the cleaning company provide them with contractor cleaners of the correct ethnicity.Why ? Because if they sue, the damage is 24x their monthly pay, which is next to nothing.This is a horribly bad factor for people like Jewish programmers, black sysadmins, and the like. They're doubly fucked : there's a very good legal reason for companies not to hire them, and they have a good legal incentive to be incompetent assholes, so they get fired and get legal damages from their legal anti-discrimination rights. In addition, the government's education incentives cause and strengthen the racist prejudices. Black sysadmins/programmers are worse than white sysadmins ... well of course ! If the law mandates a passing grade for black sysadmins in university is 40% where whites have to score 60%, this would be exactly the expected result wouldn't it ?In the end there is no substitute to waiting for immigrants to naturally work their way up the food chain like has mostly happened in America. Problem is simple : this takes multiple generations.This is one of the many reasons it's really bad to protect certain classes of people, doubly so when we're talking ethnicities or religious groups (as opposed to say, stem graduates, legal professionals, ...). Plus it generally seems to me to fly in the face of the idea of non-discrimination. You cannot achieve a colorblind society with racist law, in fact you're achieving the opposite.Of course the problem is that discrimination laws are not trying to achieve a colorblind society. Rather they're trying to throw a religious/ethnic group a bone to prevent them from rioting, and making their situation worse in the process.Let's face it, in Western Europe if you're muslim/jewish/black/... (and not self-employed) you want to be an incompetent asshole, because that's what the law rewards. You can effectively get 2 or 3 wages paid out if you do that.

If you're incapable of seeing that it is possible for all the things I've said to be true then I don't know what to suggest.>what happens when we have herbicide-resistant GMOs for every herbicide in significant use?Then we need to use less herbicide to achieve the same effect, because we can apply it directly to the crop after planting, killing the emerged weeds. With other herbicides, they have to be applied pre-emergence, sterilising the soil, which requires larger doses. Secondarily, there's no way we will have GMOs resistant to every herbicide that are currently in significant use because many of the older, more harmful ones will soon be illegal.>You keep calling it safe but, as is often the case with chemicals meant to kill, the independent research is calling these safety claims into serious question.I'm calling it safe relative to other herbicides. To feed everyone, herbicides have to be used. These chemicals are meant to kill plants, although some of the older ones has non-specific modes of action that might also harm animals. Glyphosate in particular targets a protein, ESPS synthase, that only exists in plants and microorganisms.  It's been extensively tested and, you are wrong, there is not research calling the safety claims into question - the safety rating of glyphosate accurately reflects the state of knowledge.

Now you're saying that it is for one GMO, but trying to qualify it with a ""but"". Too late. You've already conceded the point. Now you're trying to lawyer it.Total rates of herbicide resistance have not increased since the introduction of herbicide resistant GMOs. The rate of glyphosate resistance has increased, while the rate of resistance to many other herbicides (e.g. ureas, dinitroanilines, atrazine) has slowed by a greater total rate.> Resistance is dose dependent. GMOs allow higher dosing. It's the entire point.1. Dose dependence of resistance doesn't mean what you think it means. When we say resistance is dose dependent, that means the plant is resistant only up to a threshold dose, beyond which it will suffer the normal symptoms of toxicity. It does not mean ""the more herbicide we apply the more resistance there will be"".2. Glyphosate resistance does not allow higher dosing, it allows lower dosing after the crop has been planted (non-resistant crops in general have the land treated with extreme doses several weeks before sowing).3. Herbicides select for resistance with different strengths, related to how easily mutations can lead to resistance. Glyphosate is a relatively low selector for resistance. Atrazine is an example of a very strongly resistance-selecting herbicide. By reducing the use of strongly-selecting herbicides like atrazine, Roundup-ready decreases the aggregate strength of selection for resistance.> The more herbicide-resistant GMOs we use, the more herbicides we'll use and the more resistance we'll see.No. The introduction of herbicide resistant GMOs has led to a reduction in the rate of herbicides applied for most crops, or approximately similar rates of less harmful herbicides applied in other crops."

Also using IB as an actual currency exchanger where I get cash from US account A to CAD account B is actually pretty hard to do, they charge fees to do it, and there are long delays in the process.  They basically only want you to use their FX platform to try to make money exchanging currencies, but once you want to cash out, you have to convert everything back to you home currency and take it back as a domestic transfer.I've researched this extensively, since I had to pay my Canadian student loan while working in the US.  The easiest and cheapest way to do it ended up being a schwab debit card with it's %0 currency exchange fee and ATM refunds. A close second would be BTC.  Then it's Paypal, then it's the retail bank (think a chase checking account) international wire transfer service with $50 fees. Only schwab and & BTC would be relatively instant.The actual currency exchange is also not transparent at all whenever I use any of these services except Paypal and BTC. I charge $XXX CAD, and some time later I'll see a charge for $XXX USD on my bank statement.  I have a large time-span where they could of transferred at any time.  I have no idea if they did profit maximizing shenanigans like BoA arranged withdrawals and deposits to maximize overdraft fees.  I just know it's about %1-2 off what I saw as the mid market price on my phone when I did the transaction even with no 'currency exchange fee'.When going from Canada to USA is even worse, since there is no such thing as a zero currency exchange fee card or account like you can get in the USA.The amount of risk I would be taking is about 1-10 minutes with Bitcoin, and 'regulated bank' isn't much solace when things like Cyprus, Argentina and others happen.  Then there is the domestic transfer out time, which can be fairly quick or up to a day or two.  But when your at that stage, all of the currency exchange risk is gone.The uneven international exchange rates are a double edge sword that will go away as the market gets bigger.  The sell/buy spread between kraken and bitstamp for example is less compared to cavirtex.In practice sending money from US to Canada with BTC is about as much work as using paypal.  You just have to compare the two before you do the transfer. Sometimes it really in your favor to do BTC, sometimes it's better to do paypal."

Western Union is probably worse to some place like Brazil or the Philippines.With Bitcoin exchanges, I can buy BTC at a total of %0.5-1 currency exchange fee, wait 10 minutes and pay pretty much no fees outside of that. We can both use our free and relatively bullshit free domestic transfer services to transfer money in and out of the exchanges. Because of the speed of transacting, the spread from delays are minimal."

I mean trivially.  It's apparently insanely effective, though, half because it has a really good handle on who it wants to frustrate and the other half because it's not in the literature at all and, as a consequence, the bad guys don't even know they have to avoid defenses in that class of algorithms.

(Actually the way we bind is a lot like Angular, but without being a templating language.)A key design requirement is that the model does not get polluted with special methods and properties to support the binding -- so (for example) if you have nice RESTful services, you can GET, bind, edit, POST/PUT and everything just works.

The government is incompetent (and corrupt) to choose what course of action best manages risk.The better answer is to make people (and their insurance carriers) liable for the damage they actually cause. If you drive too fast and kill someone, you should be liable for a Very Large sum of money. If you drive 90MPH and cause no damage, you should be left to your devices. If driving fast has a high correlation to causing damage then insurance companies will figure out a way to charge higher premiums to people who take more risks (with risks defined scientifically by statisticians rather than corruptly by politicians), and the higher premiums will either deter the risky behavior to the extent that the damage caused by the risk is in excess of the value of getting there faster to the driver, or alternatively cause the driver to pay money in the amount necessary to compensate for the risk being imposed on others.There is no need for criminal penalties, which do nothing but create animosity between the police and the population, encourage lawbreaking, encourage the police to issue unwarranted citations (and set inappropriate speed limits or unsafely short yellow lights) in order to generate revenue, etc.The same applies to illicit drug use.

2513,1067,0.0,1.0,"> (We can always make that epsilon small enough that it's within the duration of the LIF.)NO, YOU CANNOT.Sorry to shout, but not only have I already said this is false (several times if you include the previous thread I linked to), I have linked to a computation that proves it's false. So once again, you are basing your reasoning on a false assumption, and therefore you are naturally reaching false conclusions. (Note that my computation proves something stronger: that the distance required, extrapolated from the LIF, for the outgoing light ray the astronaut/skydiver passes at t = 0 in the LIF to catch the first probe, is much larger than the size of the LIF. If this is true, it must also be true that the second probe can't catch the first probe within the LIF.)To briefly expand on what the computation I linked to shows: the smaller you make epsilon, the smaller the difference in velocities between the two probes can be (because the first probe has to be launched at escape velocity, and the smaller you make epsilon, the closer escape velocity gets to the velocity of light). And the smaller the velocity difference, the larger the catch-up distance, in the same proportion. So decreasing epsilon increases the catch-up distance extrapolated from the LIF such that the extrapolated catch-up distance remains much larger than the size of the LIF. (Again, my computation proves something stronger: that the catch-up distance required for the outgoing light ray, extrapolated from the LIF, increases as epsilon decreases, such that the catch-up distance remains much larger than the size of the LIF.)To expand on the expansion just a bit more: remember that, in order for there to be any potential issue to discuss at all, two things must be true: (1) the initial conditions must match in both LIFs; (2) the global prediction of whether or not the second probe catches the first must be different for the two scenarios. Requirement #2 is what forces us to change the initial velocity of the first probe when we change epsilon; requirement #1 is what forces us to change the initial velocity of the first probe in both LIFs when we change epsilon.(Actually, to expand one more bit, there is a third condition: the LIF size over which we can do the comparison at all must be the smaller of the two LIF sizes. Otherwise there would be no point to the comparison, since we could always just call globally flat spacetime an ""LIF"" and find some difference between it and an LIF in any curved spacetime by looking at effects that happen outside the range of the curved spacetime LIF.)"

This drove a whole codebreaking fascination thing with mathematics.So not wishing to miss out on all the action, a project was started called The Enigma Project which features basic codebreaking challenges (basic substitution ciphers, OTP etc) aimed at primary school children. This was started by Simon Singh / Cambridge University after good old Si released a book called The Code Book after which he wanted to drum up publicity rapidly. No other reason.So after a year or so of neglect these sheets work their way into ""photocopy circulation"" amongst schools in the UK as part of the typical ""teachers don't give a shit and just want to hand out worksheets"" culture that appeared.Obviously any other material that could be assembled cheaply was chucked on the back. Turns out there's a couple of sheets plainly marked from GCHQ in there as well as ""additional exercises"". Rather interesting as they are above what you'd consider appropriate for that age (prime factorisation and rapid factorisation techniques etc). Very odd!Now this in itself is pretty null and void but it leads into the culture which I experienced where we were asked in secondary school mathematics to enter various ""challenges"" to play off against other schools. I was pretty good at mathematics (at GCSE and A-level) and did well on these challenges but was approached after this by people recruiting for SIGINT rather than go to university. Other people who did well were similarly propositioned. I impolitely declined and relaxed into a life of electrical engineering, pizza and beer which I thoroughly don't regret.I'm worried my children will be similarly filtered out and recruited to be honest."

Appending on an immutable string through recursive function calls suddenly looks like child's play.The truth is that in most apps, these inefficiencies simply don't matter, and to all of the ""just learn how to use it right!"" replies, I would say that odds favor that those people aren't using it right at all. But in the end it just doesn't matter that much because small amounts of data, low demands, etc, just makes it an irrelevant cost.

But what it was used for in practice was almost always grotesquely inefficient.If someone had to make a loop to iterate objects to find a member on every function call, pretty soon they'll realize they should using a System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary for instance, or some other appropriate data structure (e.g. Need sorted data? Then use a sorted tree, for instance). When it's a simple LINQ query, though, it's one seemingly harmless little line, so it tends to get a pass.Pretty soon profiles were just hundreds (if not thousands) of different cases where LINQ was used as a cure-all, destroying performance under any load at all.LINQ is not magical. It is doing the same dirty work that you would be doing yourself if you needed to filter / sort / recast, but provides syntactical sugar to do so.

But if research in social psychology has shown nothing else, it's that the individual is not separate from his social environment. Even when we know better, when we should be able to rationally extricate ourselves from a situation, we continue on in it for a myriad of reasons.We see the warning signs, only to blindly rationalize them away so successfully that they disappear from conscious thought. I've been there, and I've suffered the consequences.Take an external authority figure, in this case a boss who values a person's ability to lose themselves in their work in order to get things done, and sit back. Add in a culture of co-workers who celebrate the same. Maybe the employee wants to work their way up the ladder, or maybe they just want to get the satisfaction of positive feedback from those figures. Watch as these factors slowly influence the employee's sense of perception, and eventually through it, their behaviors and how they judge them. Eventually, you'll see a affective and cognitive responses as they integrate these changed beliefs into their self-identity. This is made all the easier by the presence of authority figuresYou see this everywhere. Why do young investment bankers accept the idea that they need to work upwards of 80+ hours/week, and often, 100 or more? Worse, they not only accept it but they make it part of their core self-identity to be celebrated. Why do undergrads pull all-nighters and consider them a badge of honor? Or far more darkly, why do so many battered spouses stay with their abusive partners, justifying the abuse as something they somehow ""deserve?"" If someone tells you that you're dirt enough times, eventually even the strongest-willed of us will start to question it, and far too often, come to believe it.Across all these examples and more, the same cognitive phenomena are at work. You think this is solely a matter of willpower. It's often not. Yes, he's pushing himself. But social factors are also pushing inward on him, making it easier to do so.I'm not belaboring your end point. It's a good one, and the presence of outsiders willing to give such advice--get out, get somewhere where you can rebuild your sense of self and personal boundaries--can help empower people to act on it. But don't assume that it's as simple as turning off the screen, or that you're immune to these pressures. You're not. No one is.Given enough time, even the strongest can and will be influenced by social factors. Often, to positive ends. But not always. Given enough of the bad, eventually, everyone breaks.

And it was about time there was a good place for buying the classics, computer games are old enough for that now (so older games are not automatically too old to enjoy if you didn't grow up with them).And think about the perspective. 2 years ago, there was nothing if you wanted to reliably play games on linux, apart from the few old games released for that OS and the few good FOSS-indie games. Wine is nice, but not reliable. Now there is the humble bundle, there is Steam, and there is also GOG - three good options, two of them without DRM, all of them not expensive.It starts to become viable to get rid of Windows even if you are a gamer (I'll probably wait for League of Legends and Planetside 2 though, but only because I have Windows 7 already installed.

I don't mind Objective-C, but compared to C#/F# (yep F#! Nice!) it's not very nice for my taste. Xamarin fixes that with 2 very nice languages and a solidly written small layer on the native API.I have produced apps for iOS and Android with it after having written many native apps for both, so the transition was very easy as you use the same API's. You just reuse a lot of non-UI code.Note that I don't use visual tools for either platforms; not in Xamarin nor native; all UI is handcoded which, for me, has been proven to be a lot faster indeed. Reuse, refactoring and reasoning with UI code are easy that way while these visual aids don't really do anything beyond ""Hello World"".QT Creator is nice but when I tried it 6 months ago it was not ready for prime time mobile wise and it is an abstraction over the gui/api meaning it is farther away from the API/device than you would sometimes want.Intel XDK to me was a horrible experience, but after making so many HTML5 mobile / hybrid apps, I learned to hate the process. It's not ready; just forget about it for now. Make web stuff (responsive, web apps) in HTML5, make apps in something else.I would suggest learning native (Java/Objective-C) first, getting some good experience with that in, then moving away from the visual tooling like storyboards etc (It's a matter of taste but > 100 apps later I would never use it again unless it improves a lot somehow... and I don't see that happening) and then maybe use something like Xamarin  if you don't like the original native languages or want to reuse a lot of code. A more painful way of reuse which is used in games a lot is to write the common code in C++ and only the UI in the native tech.

3641,8941,2.079441541679836,8.0,"I checked out this guy's site.  I understand he is reinventing the wheel.  I respect that and do not mean anything negative about that.  A lot of us are here to understand the wheel and build for ourselves.  There is good value for that.What I do not understand, with all due respect, is the value of Github, and to a lesser extent Bitbucket, is in the features outside of the VCS core and how most people realize there is nothing Git-like to replace the actual project management tools where people find Github value. That is, bug tracking/issue tracking is the killer feature.To self-host this is problematic.  This is not to say there are not good solutions.  Traditionally that is Bugzilla, Trac, Redmine, and more recently a la ArchLinux and Music Player Daemon (MPD) I have seen Mantis BT.  It looks interesting.  The problem is, as others point out, maintenance, and adding the centralized to the decentralized, thus the point of Git, Mercurial, and others.  I noticed this guy hosts his own repos (I tried links to bugsplat.rb) and it did not load, but I assume there is not bug tracking, despite the name.Even this year, I decided to look into the state of DVCS integrated bug tracking.  Very few tools exist, or many have problems.  BE, bugseverywhere, kind of exists and has seen contributions as of last year.  Ticgit was forked to ticgit-ng, but ironically that is a Github project and its bugs are in the Github issue tracker.  There was a very cool Perl project, which seems abandoned, called SimpleDefects (SD), which also wanted to do distributed bug tracking.  It was going to sync with Github and other issue tracker systems with decentralizaton, so you could git pull for bugs as well.  This one has not seen updates for years, as I can tell, but might be the coolest of them.Unfortunately, keeping you whole project decentralized is difficult.  I have begun to look into fossil again, despite what people here say, because it might be ugly, but no VCS has its own bug tracker or wiki integration, all written in C.  It is the SCM and bug tracker for Sqlite, Tcl, and even for all of NetBSD packages.  The last really surprised me.  I think for the little guy, that is ideal.  Monotone might be worth revisiting (I had multiple problems 3 or 4 months ago because it was embedding Lua and they had not come up to the 5.1-5.2 API changes and builds failed; everyone is hard to find), even with the only data about it is there page and links to snarky Linus Torvalds jokes about the horror of OO data structures and modern C++ programming for a SCM.In short, you should know to host your own Git repos (they are designed, with the native package tools in Git or others) to host simply on a website.  It is best for even the lowest footprint web servers, shared hosting or not.What git does not have, is the beautiful features that keep people on Github all day.  I really wish distributed bug tracking advanced, but no one is interested.  This topic only comes up when Github is down (or maybe in this case but Github is having publicity problems today).  If people made a good tool like SD, that has its own bug tracking that syncs well with Github or (insert hosted SCM here), that would be fantastic.  I could be more relaxed, principally, by relying on such tools.Back to read the Fossil manual."

The fact is that gravitational waves have been detected already, though indirectly, and a Nobel prize was awarded for the observations more than 20 years ago. That's not why the BICEP2 results are a big deal.The reason this news is important is two fold. One, the researchers were able to observe the effect of ""b-mode"" gravitational waves during the earliest moments of the big bang (within the first 10^-34 seconds) which reveal important details about the specifics of the big bang. They are indirectly observing an event which is older than all matter in the Universe, older than the cosmic microwave background, older than the cosmic neutrino background, older than dark matter even (which has a high likelihood of originating from the very early Universe when the 4 fundamental forces were still unified). Two, their observations are the first direct test for the theory of cosmic inflation which seems to have produced a definitive result and the result is significant evidence for inflation.That, in turn, translates some theories into realities. For example, we tend to hedge our bets when it comes to estimating the size of the Universe, because only so much of it is visible to us. In a Universe where inflation holds the non-visible Universe must be unimaginably huge compared to the visible portion of it by many orders of magnitude. Also, most inflationary theories effectively produce multiverses (this is hard to explain, basically it's like a foam of different regions of the universe which are effectively universes unto themselves due to speed of light / expansion rate constraints)."

Its directives are nice for building small custom widgets, and the thin model wrappers $http and $resource can be useful (though I'm looking forward to what they add to these in v2.0). Data-binding is very straightforward and easy to understand.I've built a couple of projects in Meteor, and I'm still a fan, though I've yet to have a real use case for the realtime (pub/sub) stuff: I'm still making straightforward webapps that would probably be just as easy (if not easier) to build in Angular or Backbone. The reason I'm using Meteor is more for productivity than for reactive realtime: I love that I get Mongo, a watched asset pipeline and a bunch of other stuff for free. I love being able to share/move code around easily between the client and server.Sometimes the reactivity in Meteor can be quite subtle and difficult to get your head around, and I wish I was just using straightforward webservices instead; other times it's a productivity booster and keeps things simpler.ReactJS is a really nice concise view library, with some extra stuff that Facebook put in that I'm not sure should really be in there (e.g. the synthetic events) and should maybe be a module instead (an approach I'm very happy to see Angular taking). ReactJS does for views and templates what Meteor does for client-server. It's also got its share of subtleties and gotchas though.I'm also from a video games background and am also tending to favour Meteor and ReactJS.

It's 6:30am and I'm working through my first cup of coffee still. I'm not intentionally trying to be a grumpy old man.For the rest of us, I'm concerned that yet-another-package-manager (YAPM? Yap-meager?) will just continue to fracture the library ecosystem.Why can't something like APT handle it? NPM doesn't work the same as PIP, doesn't work the same as Nuget, doesn't work the same as Gem, other than the most basic install functionality. Packaging libraries for distribution is different for each, and if you have a problem, tearing into the system to figure out where the failure occurred is different for each.Maybe it's because, through hard-fought experience, I've finally learned how to manage .NET dependencies without too much headache. Don't ever even think of trying to use the GAC. Don't let your developers install the dependencies on their own. Just make a directory full of DLLs in your project root and use relative paths to load them. It's the only way I've been able to get developers up and running with a project in Visual Studio as soon as they clone the repository. Even Nuget gave me issues (though granted, I gave up on it so fast I don't remember what they were, other than telling the jr. dev to just dump the DLL in the libs directory already and get to work on the issue list).Attempting to isolate your library ecosystem from the file system feels like it encourages ""reinventing the wheel"" at the language level for libraries that will mostly be the same across platforms. Do we really need to figure out how to do database connections in yet another language? Why are there 15 different syntaxes for positional arguments in strings?I'm just getting a little... weary... of starting to learn a new programming and spending the next few hours just figuring out that they've renamed printf to writeln and %s to {0} for no good reason, or that there are no database connectors yet, or if there are they only implement a strange subset of databases. It almost feels like language devs have gone out of their way to be superficially different from everyone else, without being substantially different.Given that most languages have support for some kind of foreign function interface, especially with the C ABI, it seems like we have the tools available to us to start building cross-platform libraries and distribute them regardless of consuming language.I've been wanting to dabble in Rust for a little while, but damn, yet another package manager to learn, yet another notion of what a library ecosystem should look like, just doesn't excite me right now. It's time I will have to spend to get in the door, and I am not even sure right now if I will want to stick around.But I suppose with an initiative like Rust, isolation is probably the correct ideology, considering it's about security/performance before productivity.Anyway, complaining done. No hate for Rust-team's work. Just kind of yearning for a probably unobtainable utopian future :/"

4386,7347,0.0,1.0,"I did this a couple of years ago. I would not suggest jumping 100% into using a standing desk, but have a stool handy and it can be a great experience. I've since moved out of the coworking space I was in and have everything home, so I'm back to sitting, but I'd prefer to have a standing desk again. Just been too lazy to build one.I was pretty skeptical of standing desks when they first became all the rage on LifeHacker, et. al. But these hipsters kept harping on dubious health benefits and were missing the best part of the standing desk: it multiplies your storage space on your desk! For a coworking space, this is a major win. I ended up kicking off a ""build vertical"" craze in the space.http://moron4hire.tumblr.com/post/58110389840/last-year-i-ha...It took me just as long to draw everything as to build the standing desk. In terms of a carpentry project, it's about as simple as they come; bird houses are harder. Also, you kind of have to ""figure it out as you go"", because the desk needs to be custom built to your measurements. As you can see in my drawings, everything was designed around my eye-level height and my arm length. This is a must, or you're just trading one posture problem for another.I eventually (not pictured) also built a ""draft table"" feature into the lower desk top: removing the laptop, the desktop could be rotated into a slanted position to have an ergonomic writing surface.One thing to realize is that most people's shoes (even running sneakers) have a significant heel-rise that will really screw up your standing posture and is not conducive to standing all day. I had very significant lower back pain until I started standing barefoot, wearing slippers, or standing on a slanted platform I built to counter the heel-rise of my sneakers. I liked barefoot the best, but the room I was in had a lot of sharps on the floor.You won't be able to work all day. I could only get about 6 hours a day in until I was just too exhausted to be able to think. However, I also found that during that 6 hours I was incredibly energized and laser focused on work. I never goofed off when I used my desk. I don't know why. But 6 hours was enough to get work done.After the first month of non-stop standing, it wasn't getting any easier. I switched between standing and sitting on a stool (which I also built, which my fellow coworkers have declared the most dangerous thing ever built in the space, but has survived longer than many store-bought chairs) all day. I still mostly stood, and only sat in the stool near the end of the day. It was also useful for getting over that 6 hour hump so I could play LAN games with the other people in the space at night.I'm considering doing it again. Perhaps I'll get pre-fab foot stools or a step ladder. Our condo is pretty small and I've spilt out over everywhere. Having a standing desk would go a long way to keeping the peace with my wife in regards to clutter :)"

4905,8291,0.0,1.0,"If you're going to try to do practical things in Common Lisp, make sure you get well acquainted with quicklisp, for easy library installation, and http://www.cliki.net/ for finding out about half of those libraries.  I say you have/will want to do a lot yourself, but you don't have to do it all.Be aware that SICP is written for Scheme.  They're both lisp dialects, but they are different.  I've done bits of it here and there in Common Lisp, but the two variable namespaces, no first class continuations, different function names, less emphasis on recursion (due to specific iteration forms/macros in Common lisp) and native efficient data structures offered by common lisp might make some things non-applicable or difficult even if you're already familiar with the language.  Tail call optimization is, i believe, not required  in the Common Lisp standard, but I believe SBCL performs it, at least above certain low optimization declarations.I've only just started looking at multi-threading in Common Lisp myself.  I imagine the proper answer about ""mature"" parellelization is no, relative to some other languages (i have no real basis for this, just side-knowledge that other languages focus on such issues more.  Hell, its probably better than R.).  Multi-threading is not established in the language specification, but in practice, implementations have their own version of it, including SBCL, which is the version I'm sticking to for numerical work.  If you're looking into it, I believe you might also get acquainted with Bordeaux Threads.  Once you've got quicklisp installed, you can install that easily from there :PThat being said, when you're performing something 10-500 times faster than the interpreted memory-hungry mess that is R for example, the complication of multi-threading can fall down the priority list...Totally independent of my decision to try to the language, i later found this paper,which suggests that one of the authors of R is well aware of and in agreement with some of my own observations, plus there's a benchmark in there of common lisp, R, and python, though take all such microbenchmarks with a grain of salt, because you will be spending more programmer time in Common Lisp:https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Compstat-20...Unlike some language zealots, i feel its my responsibility to remind you this is the road less traveled. I don't think its the way industry/academia is moving.  I think there is, perhaps arrogantly, a selection bias in who becomes a Common Lisp programmer, such that inquisitive/smart/alternatively-thinking people tend to be attracted to the language, but if you think it will magically makes you 100 times better than you already are because some other smart guy uses it, put that idea right out of your head.But also honestly, I've found the experience extremely rewarding, and I code my own projects in Common lisp now where I can.I came in the top 20 of http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extr... by literally coding something up from scratch in common lisp, and my model had easy room for improvement and was among the fastest, so you can most certainly compete writing in lisp.Now, aside from my eternal side-project, I'm trying to put something together in the field of data linking in Common Lisp. I think its one of the only options that will let me combine the flexibility of dynamic languages with the performance of C...(i'm actually hoping to perform better than the US Census Bureau C program)...I already know it blows the current python/R options out of the water, but time will tell whether I can match it with C performance-wise..."
4909,2842,1.9459101490553128,7.0,"The Times seems to quote officials as saying they know this via ACARS messages. However, assuming the primary radar returns are good enough, this is reasonably inferred by its radar track alone - the chances of hitting 4 separate navigation waypoints (IGARI, VAMPI, GIVAL, IGREX) based on random human flying is pretty much nil. So this may be just confirmation of what most investigators were already assuming.Sad as it is to say, at this point I think the most likely cause is a bizarre pilot suicide. That night one of the pilots likely allowed a dark, dark thought they once had to overtake them for some reason.First this person programmed a set of remote 5-letter nav waypoints into the FMC without the other pilot noticing - not a difficult task by my understanding. Most likely to hide the evidence for insurance reasons, or just out of shame, to hide his actions from the world (a long flight also ensures the CVR will tape over the relevant bits after its 120min loop - CVR/FDR is one of the few things that cannot be disabled from the cockpit of a 777).After the radio handoff, the other pilot left the cockpit for a moment. The perpetrator then set the transponder to standby and disabled ACARS messages from being sent via both VHF and SATCOM. Finally, in order to ensure hypoxia took hold quickly, he set the plane to climb as high as the autopilot would take it (which ended up being ~FL450), and then depressurized the plane, quickly and painlessly killing everyone aboard, including himself. Multiple airline pilots in the airliners.net forums have been discussing these possibilities and they seem to agree that all of these things can be performed by a single pilot, in a few minutes time, entirely from the cockpit. The ghost plane then flew the programmed route until running out of fuel.While this is certainly bizarre, unlikely, and hard to fathom, I posit that it is the least unlikely scenario, because it can be done entirely by one person whose motives we don't understand. Historically, there have been many people who have done bizarre, horrendous things for motives we can't begin to understand - whether due to insanity, sociopathy or zealotry. I truly hope I'm wrong, but I just can't see a grand multinational hijacking conspiracy as being more likely than a sad man wishing to end his sad life in an evil way.If you're thinking of replying to this with your own theory, let me just add that I say all of this not to add flame to the fire of speculation, or to accuse a potentially innocent man of mass murder, but to try and finally put the whole thing to rest in my own mind - I seem to have been rather obsessed with the whole story over the past few days. While the past week has been a flurry of information and misinformation, it's quite likely we will never know what happened to MH370, at least not for a very long time. We need to find the explanations for ourselves that allow us to come to peace with the incident personally, so that we can collectively move on at some point."

I do expect the post to bother Americans because it goes against what I call the myth of interchangeability, the idea that gender equality necessarily reduces to the idea that the sexes are interchangeable.  I don't believe this and I think that equality has to be more substantive than this because interchangeability tends to mean that a male-normative model gives you hidden sexism.  Exhibit A is Marissa Mayer's maternity leave duration.  There is nothing equal about that.The point is that when you look cross-culturally and cross-historically, where you don't have women certain things like rule of law don't happen (you see this develop in the American West for example as gender rates stopped being so lopsided).I would suggest that recognizing that the genders do have differences in terms of social aptitudes and needs, and different positions relative to life choices is the first step in reducing the male-normative view on our economic model (i.e. ""if you work like a man, and wait to have kids like a man, you will get paid like a man"")."

A big part of identifying trends and devising strategies is being able to sort out what's worth getting on top of, just watching, or dismissing outright. Same for journalism.This article was a typical counter-hype pageview driver pounded out for a deadline. The writers job was to make a plausible-sounding story for the opposite side.Its the plausible-sounding story part thats tripping people up here. Here's what he did:\n* He says everyone is going gaga over it\n* He gives a bunch of reasons why they'll have a tough time in the market\n* He cites a random analyst\n* He muses his personal take on its market feasibility and makes a strawman argument about it being a 'defensive product' that he summarily knocks down\n* He concludes, decisively, that nothing is going to changeWe've all read this article. Its like the 5 paragraph essay from grade school. And like the 5 paragraph essay, it can be graded for how much it makes sense.Just on cursory view, he clearly hasn't done his homework on Apple or consumer trends. Namely, he doesn't address the success factors and relevant details of the iPod.1. He cites price as an issue (but the iPod was almost the same price, anchoring high end value before dropping in price to get mass market scale).2. He mentions people really excited about the iPhone but later muses he doesn't know who its targeted at (how does he think Apple sells things? tech specs?).3. He suggests the playing field is level against competing models (ignoring the demonstrated ecosystem power of iTunes, the fact that no ecosystem exists in phones, and of course, ignoring the holyshit demo that showed iPhone's superior usability).4. He says at the end an outside player may come provide competition but they'd have to bring some new tech or different user experience (ignoring the decades of R groundwork and IP portfolio that Apple laid for the iPhone, all the way back to tech demos in the 80s and the Newton in the 90s).In other words, he's probably dodging the issue or doesn't know anything. This quote is great:""Likewise, who is it pitched at? The price and the e-mail features make it look like a business product. But Apple is a consumer company.""He's grappling aloud with a square peg in a round hole of his own making. Like the rest of the article, nowhere in there is the author demonstrating an ability to imagine something that does not exist today - the basic skill required to understand the history of technology.To a reader without any industry knowledge, at the very least the context of what type of article this is (a counter-hype story), the logical inconsistencies within the arguments, and the complete lack of imagination would raise a flag about how valid this piece is.To a reader with industry knowledge, they'd see points 1-4 not covered and think this guy shouldn't have his job.-- \nNow to your example, I don't think these are the same type of prediction.That the iPhone would be a general market success was an easy prediction, because the playbook and success of the iPod was right there, and it was easy to see that phones were going to be like the iPhone once it was shown, because it was that much better.The Fuji vs Kodak is a hard prediction, because those companies are having their core business models threatened by an external change looming over them. The change here isn't about the success or failure of a product, it's about whether companies can manage a transformation. Transformations are hard and messy, and hard to predict.I see the 'its hard to predict the future' argument as more than a little bit similar to ""correlation is not causation"" that seems to pop up here occasionally. Yes, correlation is not causation, but it can imply it, depending on the circumstances, measurements, R^2, etc. Similarly, the conditions for a future prediction depend on what information we have, what the context is of change, what we're trying to predict, etc.The only thing I think where the iPhone prediction was difficult was just how crazy a success it was. But whether it was going to be a general success or general failure? For anyone who knew a bit about the iPod, that should have been answered the moment they saw the demo.EDIT: All this said, I definitely agree with the important lesson to balance short/long term and not try to over-predict the future, especially when it comes to the path individuals are on. I think thats what you were getting at at the end. Wisdom of this kind is important in this (young) community."

In addition, any mixed-signal IC represents a design compromise between digital and analog constraints.Any signal processing system is inherently limited by the SNR of its source signal. There is no point in building a more accurate converter than the noisiest component of your input data. In fact, when metrologists are trying achieve the maximum accuracy in their measurements, it is not uncommon to leave a test circuit on for days at a time, in order to reach a thermal equilibrium to minimize the seebeck effect[2].And when engineers to need to make the most accurate of measurements, what do they turn to?

In a dangerous area, a camera cannot capture the entire environment that a police officer must take in, contextual clues to a possibly dangerous situation drawn from a career of near brushes with disaster. So you might see corner cases where a police officer either (a) disregards their gut feeling to exercise caution and speed when apprehending a suspect because they fear being captured on camera, and the officer is injured as a result, or (b) follows their gut feeling, exercises due caution and speed, perhaps is rough on a criminal who has violent intent, and then must allow the criminal to go free even if that caution was necessary, because the jury was more sympathetic to the video of so-called ""brutality"" than they were to the officer's justifiable mental model of the situation, which cannot be presented so elegantly.Would this system work for less dangerous areas?

But more than extending their tooling to competitor's platforms, I think this is a sneaky way to actually make their platform more viable.Microsoft has tried to pay individual developers to get them to develop for WP, but this is short-sighted and ultimately doesn't address the opportunity cost involved. There are a number of cross-platform mobile tools out there (PhoneGap/Cordova, Telerik Icenium, Xamarin, etc). For a small team, it's damn near impossible to maintain both Android and iOS, let alone Windows Phone.The fact that Xamarin is compiled to native code and built around Mono makes it a particularly interesting play, since it's probably better suited for games as compared to the HTML 5-based solutions.I evaluated, and liked, Xamarin a lot. As a .NET developer and part of a very small team, it made a ton of sense for me. The main issue was price - it's very expensive which kind of becomes cost prohibitive for the small team that it is a great fit for.If Microsoft buys Xamarin and builds it into Visual Studio (or gives it away as part of MSDN/BizSpark), all of a sudden you have a lot of people building mobile apps in C#/.NET - and targeting Windows Phone becomes much, much easier.Microsoft can't compete straight up  with Android or iOS because it doesn't have the same audience that either of those platforms have. But providing tooling that makes our lives easier doing cross platform development is an ingenious trojan horse to getting people to be able to target Windows Phone as well.... or even Windows 8 for that matter since it's just the CLR at the end of the day.[1] http://tmarman.com/Blog/Post/ba9a711f-dcdb-40b5-bca9-ad6eb5b..."

The slideout keyboard was way more accurate than the software keyboard on the iPhone, and Apple hadn't entirely figured out autocomplete (I think their keyboard is still poor compared to swipe etc, tbh).2b. It was durable - it never died after being thrown off stairs, slammed on the ground, crushed in backpacks, stepped on, getting dropped in a river, etc etc. Towards the end of its lifepan, when I wanted to get an Android phone, I found that I couldn't easily kill it even if I tried. On the other hand, my friend shattered their iPhone by bumping their pocket into the corner of a table.2c. 3g, and ATT only. 2g is basically unusable for browsing the desktop web, and ATT sucks.2d. Anybody could, and many people did, publish whatever apps you wanted. I was able to download a full offline database of German public transit schedules and navigate flawlessly in cities I had never been to (which was a big deal), SSH into servers in emergencies (using the aforementioned full-size keyboard), full offline GPS of the continental US (something that's difficult to come by even today!) and so on and so on. The iPhone on launch was basically an expensive consumer toy, had no allowances for third-party developers, and Steve was telling everyone that they were better off without them.In an expansion of my last point, myself (and a lot of other people) didn't so much think that the iPhone was going to fail as dread its success. The iPhone, and really Apple, represent and drive the trend of consumerization and broader locking down of computing.And I think that we were right to do so - the broader population largely thinks of their handheld general-purpose computers as texting and passive content consumption devices, because that's all they're allowed to be.

And the only explanation is that this stigma about global variables has a religious and un-questioned association with incompetence.  Unfortunately that particular cargo cult can lead to things like Angular DI.Why aren't more web developers excited about Polymer and Web Components?

Every comment I've seen thus far doesn't seem to grasp that this is MANDATORY before you have the ability to finish installing a new bootloader.  This is how UEFI protects itself from unauthorized OS signing!I have my own custom EFI vars set up with grub2 running on a GPT partition table, all booting beside windows, as purely as the air you breathe, and I'm loading custom Linux kernels daily and haven't ran into an issue since I originally set it up.  Grub2 itself is my primary boot partition, which can then jump into the windows boot manager on the other disk.Grub2 itself has the capacity to act as a custom-signed EFI boot partition (Not sure if I've got the wording on that correct -- but the gist is there!).  This means grub can be what your bios looks for the signature from.  You don't absolutely need your kernel to be signed, provided you can get a signature produced from grub, OR you have the ability to write one while in a signed O/S.IF you want the easiest approach, look no further than any Linux distribution that purchased a key to find such a  signed environment that permits the further writing of EFI variables.Or, even easier -- just write then boot grub 2's EFI-signed bootloader to a usb key to get started.  After that, writing a new OS entry to UEFI should be the most straightforward thing to do in the world!*(You can even boot any kernel in the world with such a signed grub2 USB disk!)"

Since most arrays would have pieces with lower numbers( 2,4,8 ) you could very efficiently compress the data.At some point you would run out of memory but it would be playable. Just like those Game of Life implementations with seemingly infinite grid."

That's something many institutions do, it's not just done exclusively when it concerns racial issues. Hell, the fact that it was a racial issue gives them more incentive to keep silence.As for his friends, they might have simply decided it wasn't worth expending energy on a lowlife punk."

The main disagreements were how the story was massively pinned everywhere as one of sexism, when the main conflict involved another woman, and then the man who reversed Horvath's commits appeared to hold a grudge, not necessarily sexist attitudes.Sorry about the incident you describe, but I'm having a hard time extrapolating it to systemic racism. It appeared that it was an uneducated punk trying to impress a love interest through the only brutish way he knows: violence. He also needs to intimidate you somehow, and your race stands out. So what do you think he's going to do, in that case? Comment on your race, of course. People of lower caliber tend to focus on these superficialities.Oh, and they also tend to be highly effective insults. There's that, too. If your goal is to offend, racial slurs are an invaluable tool.But even if we were to assume that this arbitrary incident from over 25 years ago is evidence of current events, I still cannot take your claim that the tech industry is ""as welcoming to women as medicine and law were a century ago"" at face value.Secret WASP classes, indeed. Most higher education today is the polar opposite of that ideologically, but there you go."
